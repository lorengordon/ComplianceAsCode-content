description: 'The RPM package management system includes the ability

    to verify the integrity of installed packages by comparing the

    installed files with information about the files taken from the

    package metadata stored in the RPM database. Although an attacker

    could corrupt the RPM database (analogous to attacking the AIDE

    database as described above), this check can still reveal

    modification of important files. To list which files on the system differ from
    what is expected by the RPM database:

    <pre>$ rpm -qVa</pre>

    See the man page for <tt>rpm</tt> to see a complete explanation of each column.'

description: 'To ensure the logon failure delay controlled by <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>
    is set properly,

    add or correct the <tt>FAIL_DELAY</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> to
    read as follows:

rationale: 'Increasing the time between a failed authentication attempt and re-prompting
    to

    enter credentials helps to slow a single-threaded brute force attack.'

description: 'The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,

    is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration

    files. The NIS client (<tt>ypbind</tt>) was used to bind a system to an NIS server

    and receive the distributed configuration files.'
rationale: 'The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable

    to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying

    NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight

    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be

    removed.'

description: 'Ensure that none of the directories in root''s path is equal to a single

    <tt>.</tt> character, or

    that it contains any instances that lead to relative path traversal, such as

    <tt>..</tt> or beginning a path without the slash (<tt>/</tt>) character.

    Also ensure that there are no "empty" elements in the path, such as in these examples:

    <pre>PATH=:/bin

    PATH=/bin:

    PATH=/bin::/sbin</pre>

    These empty elements have the same effect as a single <tt>.</tt> character.'
rationale: 'Including these entries increases the risk that root could

    execute code from an untrusted location.'

description: The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a service that provides
    a method for looking up information from a central database.
rationale: 'If the system will not need to act as an LDAP server, it is recommended
    that the software be

    disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.'

ocil_clause: the "slapd" is loaded and not masked
ocil: 'To check that the <code>slapd</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>slapd</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>slapd</code> service has either not been installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>slapd</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>slapd</code> is not active (i.e. not
    running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active slapd</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>slapd</code> is masked,
    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>slapd</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'

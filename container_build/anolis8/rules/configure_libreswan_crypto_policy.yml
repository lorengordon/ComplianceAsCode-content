description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    Libreswan is supported by system crypto policy, but the Libreswan configuration
    may be

    set up to ignore it.


    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the
    <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>

    includes the appropriate configuration file.

    In <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>, make sure that the following line

    is not commented out or superseded by later includes:

    <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>'
rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan

    service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more

    fragmented.'

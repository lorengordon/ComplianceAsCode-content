description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    OpenSSL is supported by crypto policy, but the OpenSSL configuration may be

    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, you have to examine
    the OpenSSL config file

    available under <tt>/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf</tt>.

    This file has the <tt>ini</tt> format, and it enables crypto policy support

    if there is a <tt>[ crypto_policy ]</tt> section that contains the <tt>.include
    /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config</tt> directive.'
rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Java runtime
    violates expectations,

    and makes system configuration more fragmented.'

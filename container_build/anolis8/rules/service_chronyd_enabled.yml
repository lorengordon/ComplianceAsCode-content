description: "chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP)\
    \ is designed to\nsynchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use\
    \ a source that is highly\naccurate. More information on chrony can be found at\n\
    \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/'>http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</a>.\n\
    Chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.\nTo enable Chronyd service,\
    \ you can run:\n<tt># systemctl enable chronyd.service</tt>\nThis recommendation\
    \ only applies if chrony is in use on the system."
rationale: 'If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring
    time

    synchronization is working properly.'

            forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the

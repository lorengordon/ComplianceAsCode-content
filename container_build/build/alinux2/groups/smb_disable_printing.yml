description: "By default, Samba utilizes the CUPS printing service to enable\nprinter\
    \ sharing with Microsoft Windows workstations. If there are no printers\non the\
    \ local system, or if printer sharing with Microsoft Windows is not\nrequired,\
    \ disable the printer sharing capability by commenting out the\nfollowing lines,\
    \ found in <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>:\n<pre>[global]\n  load printers = yes\n\
    \  cups options = raw\n[printers]\n  comment = All Printers\n  path = /usr/spool/samba\n\
    \  browseable = no\n  guest ok = no\n  writable = no\n  printable = yes</pre>\n\
    There may be other options present, but these are the only options enabled and\n\
    uncommented by default. Removing the <tt>[printers]</tt> share should be enough\n\
    for most users.  If the Samba printer sharing capability is needed, consider\n\
    disabling the Samba network browsing capability or restricting access to a\nparticular\
    \ set of users or network addresses. Set the <tt>valid users</tt>\nparameter to\
    \ a small subset of users or restrict it to a particular group of\nusers with\
    \ the shorthand <tt>@</tt>. Separate each user or group of users with\na space.\
    \ For example, under the <tt>[printers]</tt> share:\n<pre>[printers]\n  valid\
    \ users = user @printerusers</pre>"

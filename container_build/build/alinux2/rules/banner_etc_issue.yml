    The DoD required text is either:

    <br /><br />

    <tt>You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that

    is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes

    any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

    <br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS

    for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC

    monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law

    enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

    <br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

    <br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,

    are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be

    disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

    <br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access

    controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or

    privacy.

    <br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent

    to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of

    privileged communications, or work product, related to personal

    representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and

    their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and

    confidential. See User Agreement for details.</tt>

    <br /><br />

    OR:

    <br /><br />

    <tt>I''ve read &amp; consent to terms in IS user agreem''t.</tt>'
rationale: 'Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting

    access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification

    verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,

    directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

    <br /><br />

    System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces

    with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not

    exist.'

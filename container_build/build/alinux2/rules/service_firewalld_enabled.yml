    The <code>firewalld</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Access control methods provide the ability to enhance system security
    posture

    by restricting services and known good IP addresses and address ranges. This

    prevents connections from unknown hosts and protocols.'

        vuldiscussion: '"Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit
            remote access to the system via ports, services, and protocols.


            Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network
            devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities,
            increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.


            Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized
            user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled
            network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband,
            and wireless.

            Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking
            enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated
            control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing
            compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of
            remote access applications on a variety of information system components
            (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).'

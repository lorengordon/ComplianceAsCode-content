description: 'The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted

    representations of passwords. In "/etc/pam.d/system-auth", the

    <tt>password</tt> section of the file controls which PAM modules execute

    during a password change. Set the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module in the

    <tt>password</tt> section to include the argument <tt>sha512</tt>, as shown

    below:

    <br />


    <pre>password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>


    <br />

    This will help ensure when local users change their passwords, hashes for

    the new passwords will be generated using the SHA-512 algorithm. This is

    the default.'
rationale: 'Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard

    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can

    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that

    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are

    kepy in plain text.

    <br /><br />

    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are

    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.

    Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use

    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more

    difficult.'

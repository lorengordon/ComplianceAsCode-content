description: "Firewalls can be used to separate networks into different zones\nbased\
    \ on the level of trust the user has decided to place on the devices and\ntraffic\
    \ within that network. <tt>NetworkManager</tt> informs firewalld to which\nzone\
    \ an interface belongs. An interface's assigned zone can be changed by\n<tt>NetworkManager</tt>\
    \ or via the <tt>firewall-config</tt> tool.\n<br />\nThe zone settings in <tt>/etc/firewalld/</tt>\
    \ are a range of preset settings\nwhich can be quickly applied to a network interface.\
    \ These are the zones\nprovided by firewalld sorted according to the default trust\
    \ level of the\nzones from untrusted to trusted:\n<ul>\n<li><tt>drop</tt><br /><p>Any\
    \ incoming network packets are dropped, there is no\nreply. Only outgoing network\
    \ connections are possible.</p></li>\n<li><tt>block</tt><br /><p>Any incoming\
    \ network connections are rejected with an\n<tt>icmp-host-prohibited</tt> message\
    \ for IPv4 and <tt>icmp6-adm-prohibited</tt>\nfor IPv6. Only network connections\
    \ initiated from within the system are\npossible.</p></li>\n<li><tt>public</tt><br\
    \ /><p>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other\ncomputers on the network\
    \ to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming\nconnections are accepted.</p></li>\n\
    <li><tt>external</tt><br /><p>For use on external networks with masquerading enabled\n\
    especially for routers. You do not trust the other computers on the network to\n\
    not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>\n\
    <li><tt>dmz</tt><br /><p>For computers in your demilitarized zone that are\npublicly-accessible\
    \ with limited access to your internal network. Only selected\nincoming connections\
    \ are accepted.</p></li>\n<li><tt>work</tt><br /><p>For use in work areas. You\
    \ mostly trust the other computers\non networks to not harm your computer. Only\
    \ selected incoming connections are\naccepted.</p></li>\n<li><tt>home</tt><br\
    \ /><p>For use in home areas. You mostly trust the other computers\non networks\
    \ to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are\naccepted.</p></li>\n\
    <li><tt>internal</tt><br /><p>For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the\n\
    other computers on the networks to not harm your computer. Only selected\nincoming\
    \ connections are accepted.</p></li>\n<li><tt>trusted</tt><br /><p>All network\
    \ connections are accepted.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nIt is possible to designate\
    \ one of these zones to be the default zone. When\ninterface connections are added\
    \ to <tt>NetworkManager</tt>, they are assigned\nto the default zone. On installation,\
    \ the default zone in firewalld is set to\nbe the public zone.\n<br />\nTo find\
    \ out all the settings of a zone, for example the <tt>public zone,</tt>\nenter\
    \ the following command as root:\n<pre># firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all</pre>\n\
    Example output of this command might look like the following:\n<pre>\n# firewall-cmd\
    \ --zone=public --list-all\npublic\n  interfaces:\n  services: mdns dhcpv6-client\
    \ ssh\n  ports:\n  forward-ports:\n  icmp-blocks: source-quench\n</pre>\nTo view\
    \ the network zones currently active, enter the following command as root:\n<pre>#\
    \ firewall-cmd --get-service</pre>\nThe following listing displays the result\
    \ of this command\non common Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 system:\n<pre>\n# firewall-cmd\

    \ the next firewalld\nservice reload, enter the following command as root:\n<pre>#\

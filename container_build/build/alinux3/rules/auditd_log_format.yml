        srg_requirement: Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 must produce audit records containing
            information to establish the identity of any individual or process associated
            with the event.
        vuldiscussion: 'Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source
            of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would
            be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading
            up to an outage or attack.


            Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement
            includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses,
            user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications,
            filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.


            Enriched logging aids in making sense of who, what, and when events occur
            on a system.  Without this, determining root cause of an event will be
            much more difficult.'

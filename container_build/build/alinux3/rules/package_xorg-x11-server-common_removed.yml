description: 'By removing the xorg-x11-server-common package, the system no longer
    has X Windows

    installed. If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical
    user mode.

    This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a
    <tt>graphical.target</tt>

    mode. To do so, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo yum groupremove "X Window System"</pre>

    <pre>$ sudo yum remove xorg-x11-server-common</pre>'
rationale: 'Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system. X windows has a long history of security

    vulnerabilities and should not be installed unless approved and documented.'

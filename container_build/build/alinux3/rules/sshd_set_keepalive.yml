description: 'The SSH server sends at most <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> messages

    during a SSH session and waits for a response from the SSH client.

    The option <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt> configures timeout after

    each <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> message. If the SSH server does not

    receive a response from the client, then the connection is considered unresponsive

    and terminated.

    For SSH earlier than v8.2, a <tt>ClientAliveCountMax</tt> value of <tt>0</tt>

    causes a timeout precisely when the <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt> is set.

    Starting with v8.2, a value of <tt>0</tt> disables the timeout functionality

    completely. If the option is set to a number greater than <tt>0</tt>, then

    the session will be disconnected after

    <tt>ClientAliveInterval * ClientAliveCountMax</tt> seconds without receiving

    a keep alive message.'
rationale: 'This ensures a user login will be terminated as soon as the <tt>ClientAliveInterval</tt>

    is reached.'

        vuldiscussion: 'Terminating an idle SSH session within a short time period
            reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control
            of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has
            been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session
            will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.


            Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions
            includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs
            at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments
            at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a
            single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that
            the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only
            ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that
            session.


            Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations
            of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval"
            and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold.
            The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds after which
            if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message
            through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The
            "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may
            be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this
            threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information
            on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.'

description: 'Running <tt>httpd</tt> inside a <tt>chroot</tt> jail is designed to
    isolate the

    web server process to a small section of the filesystem, limiting the damage if

    it is compromised. Versions of Apache greater than 2.2.10 (such as the one

    included with Anolis OS 8) provide the <tt>ChrootDir</tt> directive. To run Apache

    inside a chroot jail in <tt>/chroot/apache</tt>, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>: <pre>ChrootDir /chroot/apache</pre> This

    necessitates placing all files required by <tt>httpd</tt> inside

    <tt>/chroot/apache</tt> , including <tt>httpd</tt>''s binaries, modules,

    configuration files, and served web pages. The details of this configuration

    are beyond the scope of this guide. This may also require additional SELinux

    configuration.'

description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>minclass</tt> parameter controls

    requirements for usage of different character classes, or types, of character

    that must exist in a password before it is considered valid. For example,

    setting this value to three (3) requires that any password must have characters

    from at least three different categories in order to be approved. The default

    value is zero (0), meaning there are no required classes. There are four

    categories available:

    <pre>

    * Upper-case characters

    * Lower-case characters

    * Digits

    * Special characters (for example, punctuation)

    </pre>

    Modify the <tt>minclass</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt>
    entry

    to require <sub idref="var_password_pam_minclass" />

    differing categories of characters when changing passwords.'
rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password
    in resisting attempts

    at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    <br /><br />

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The

    more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that
    need to be tested before

    the password is compromised.

    <br /><br />

    Requiring a minimum number of character categories makes password guessing attacks
    more difficult

    by ensuring a larger search space.'

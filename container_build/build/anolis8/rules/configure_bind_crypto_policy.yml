description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    BIND is supported by crypto policy, but the BIND configuration may be

    set up to ignore it.


    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the
    <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>

    includes the appropriate configuration:

    In the <tt>options</tt> section of <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>, make sure that the
    following line

    is not commented out or superseded by later includes:

    <tt>include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";</tt>'
rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the BIND service
    violate expectations,

    and makes system configuration more fragmented.'

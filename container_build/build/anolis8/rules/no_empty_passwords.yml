description: 'If an account is configured for password authentication

    but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log

    into the account without authentication. Remove any instances of the

    <tt>nullok</tt> in


    <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt>


    to prevent logins with empty passwords.'
rationale: 'If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and

    run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with

    empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.'

description: "Extensions are developed by third party sources and are designed to\
    \ extend \nGoogle Chromium's functionality. As an extension can be made by anyone,\
    \ all extensions\nshould be blacklisted from installation by default. To blacklist\
    \ all extensions, set the \n<tt>ExtensionInstallBlacklist</tt> to <tt>*</tt> in\
    \ the Chromium policy file."
rationale: 'Extensions can access almost anything on a system. This means they pose
    a high risk

    to any system that would allow all extensions to be installed by default.'

description: 'Chromium can be set to run at all times and process in the background.
    This

    should be disabled by setting <tt>BackgroundModeEnabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt>

    in the Chromium policy file.'
rationale: 'There is two reasons that this is not wanted. First, it can tie up system

    resources that might otherwise be needed. Second, it does not make it

    obvious to the user that it is running and poorly written extensions could

    cause instability on the system.'

description: 'Incognito Mode allows users to browse in private which prevents monitoring

    and validating user browsing habits. This capability should be disabled by

    setting <tt>IncognitoModeAvailability</tt> to <tt>1</tt> in the Chromium

    policy file.'
rationale: 'Incognito mode allows the user to browse the Internet without recording
    their

    browsing history/activity. From a forensics perspective, this is unacceptable.

    Best practice requires that browser history is retained.'

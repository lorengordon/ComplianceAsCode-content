description: 'Each access to a URL is handled by the browser according to the URL''s
    "scheme".

    The "scheme" of a URL is the section before the ":". The term "protocol" is often

    mistakenly used for a "scheme". The difference is that the scheme is how the browser

    handles a URL and the protocol is how the browser communicates with a service.
    To

    disable insecure and obsolete protocol schema, set <tt>URLBlacklist</tt> to

    <tt><sub idref="var_url_blacklist" /></tt> in the Chromium policy file.'
rationale: 'If a scheme or its associated protocol used by a browser is insecure or
    obsolete,

    vulnerabilities can be exploited resulting in exposed data or unrestricted access

    to the browser''s system.'

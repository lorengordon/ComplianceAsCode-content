description: 'The syslog service has been the default Unix logging mechanism for

    many years. It has a number of downsides, including inconsistent log format,

    lack of authentication for received messages, and lack of authentication,

    encryption, or reliable transport for messages sent over a network. However,

    due to its long history, syslog is a de facto standard which is supported by

    almost all Unix applications.

    <br />

    <br />

    In Debian 10, rsyslog has replaced ksyslogd as the

    syslog daemon of choice, and it includes some additional security features

    such as reliable, connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the

    option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to

    a central logging server.

    This section discusses how to configure rsyslog for

    best effect, and how to use tools provided with the system to maintain and

    monitor logs.'

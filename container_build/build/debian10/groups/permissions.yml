description: 'Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and

    directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or

    modifying files to which they should not have access.

    <br /><br />

    Several of the commands in this section search filesystems

    for files or directories with certain characteristics, and are

    intended to be run on every local partition on a given system.

    When the variable <i>PART</i> appears in one of the commands below,

    it means that the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the

    name of each local partition substituted for <i>PART</i> in turn.

    <br /><br />

    The following command prints a list of all xfs partitions on the local

    system, which is the default filesystem for Debian 10

    installations:

    <pre>$ mount -t xfs | awk ''{print $3}''</pre>

    For any systems that use a different

    local filesystem type, modify this command as appropriate.'

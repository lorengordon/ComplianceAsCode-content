description: 'When the so-called ''sticky bit'' is set on a directory,

    only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the

    directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a

    directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky

    bit prevents users from removing each other''s files. In cases where

    there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better

    solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky

    bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,

    consult that application''s documentation instead of blindly

    changing modes.

    <br />

    To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the

    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized

    users to delete files in the directory structure.

    <br /><br />

    The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories

    supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file

    repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the

    system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <tt>/tmp</tt>), and

    for directories requiring global read/write access.'

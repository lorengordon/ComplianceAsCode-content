description: 'Denial-of-service attacks are difficult to detect and prevent while
    maintaining

    acceptable access to authorized users. However, some traffic-shaping

    modules can be used to address the problem. Well-known DoS protection modules
    include:

    <pre>mod_cband mod_bwshare mod_limitipconn mod_evasive</pre>

    Denial-of-service prevention should be implemented for a web server if such a
    threat exists.

    However, specific configuration details are very dependent on the environment
    and often best left

    at the discretion of the administrator.'

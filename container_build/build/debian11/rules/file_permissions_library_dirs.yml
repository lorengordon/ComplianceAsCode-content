description: 'System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables

    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

    by default:

    <pre>/lib

    /lib64

    /usr/lib

    /usr/lib64

    </pre>

    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are

    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories

    should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these

    directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct

    its permission with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>FILE</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address

    space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at

    runtime. Restrictive permissions are necessary to protect the integrity of the
    system.'

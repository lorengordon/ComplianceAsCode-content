description: 'If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition

    for <tt>/home</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If

    <tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then

    creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the

    mountpoint can instead be configured later.'
rationale: 'Ensuring that <tt>/home</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the

    setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that

    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.'

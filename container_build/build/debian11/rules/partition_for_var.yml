description: 'The <tt>/var</tt> directory is used by daemons and other system

    services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <tt>/var</tt> has its
    own partition

    or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.'
rationale: 'Ensuring that <tt>/var</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the

    setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect

    system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.

    It is not uncommon for the <tt>/var</tt> directory to contain

    world-writable directories installed by other software packages.'

description: 'The netfs script manages the boot-time mounting of several types

    of networked filesystems, of which NFS and Samba are the most common. If these

    filesystem types are not in use, the script can be disabled, protecting the

    system somewhat against accidental or malicious changes to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>

    and against flaws in the netfs script itself.


    The <code>netfs</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now netfs.service</pre>'

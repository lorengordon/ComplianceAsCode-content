description: 'Because HTTP is a plain text protocol, all traffic is susceptible to
    passive

    monitoring. If there is a need for confidentiality, SSL should be configured

    and enabled to encrypt content.

    <br /><br />

    Note: <tt>mod_nss</tt> is a FIPS 140-2 certified alternative to <tt>mod_ssl</tt>.

    The modules share a considerable amount of code and should be nearly identical

    in functionality. If FIPS 140-2 validation is required, then <tt>mod_nss</tt>
    should

    be used. If it provides some feature or its greater compatibility is required,

    then <tt>mod_ssl</tt> should be used.'

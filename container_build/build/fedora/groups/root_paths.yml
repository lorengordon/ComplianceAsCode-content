description: 'The active path of the root account can be obtained by

    starting a new root shell and running:

    <pre># echo $PATH</pre>

    This will produce a colon-separated list of

    directories in the path.

    <br /><br />

    Certain path elements could be considered dangerous, as they could lead

    to root executing unknown or

    untrusted programs, which could contain malicious

    code.

    Since root may sometimes work inside

    untrusted directories, the <tt>.</tt> character, which represents the

    current directory, should never be in the root path, nor should any

    directory which can be written to by an unprivileged or

    semi-privileged (system) user.

    <br /><br />

    It is a good practice for administrators to always execute

    privileged commands by typing the full path to the

    command.'

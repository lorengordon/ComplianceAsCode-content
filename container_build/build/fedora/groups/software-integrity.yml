description: 'Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)

    software and the RPM package management system provide

    mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.

    AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these

    to current system files in order to detect changes.

    <br /><br />

    The RPM package management system can conduct integrity

    checks by comparing information in its metadata database with

    files installed on the system.'

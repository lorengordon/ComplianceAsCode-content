        vuldiscussion: 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate
            events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct
            time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting
            forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the
            configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.


            Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of
            time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems
            connected over a network.


            Depending on the infrastruture being used the "pool" directive may not
            be supported.'

description: 'The idle time-out value for inactivity in the GNOME3 desktop is configured
    via the <tt>idle-delay</tt>

    setting must be set under an appropriate configuration file(s) in the <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d</tt>
    directory

    and locked in <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks</tt> directory to prevent user modification.

    <br /><br />

    For example, to configure the system for a 15 minute delay, add the following
    to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>:

    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/session]

    idle-delay=uint32 900</pre>'
rationale: 'A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops
    work and moves away from

    the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout
    because of the

    temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock
    their operating

    system session prior to vacating the vicinity, GNOME3 can be configured to identify
    when

    a user''s session has idled and take action to initiate a session lock.'

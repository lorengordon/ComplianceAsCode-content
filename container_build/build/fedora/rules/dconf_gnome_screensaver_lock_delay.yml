description: 'To activate the locking delay of the screensaver in the GNOME3 desktop
    when

    the screensaver is activated, add or set <tt>lock-delay</tt> to <tt>uint32 <sub
    idref="var_screensaver_lock_delay" /></tt> in

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]

    lock-delay=uint32 <sub idref="var_screensaver_lock_delay" />

    </pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
    moves away from the immediate physical vicinity

    of the information system but does not want to logout because of the temporary
    nature of the absense.'

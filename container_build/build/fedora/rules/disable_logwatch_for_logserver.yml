description: 'Does your site have a central logserver which has been configured to
    report

    on logs received from all systems? If so:

    <pre>$ sudo rm /etc/cron.daily/0logwatch</pre>

    If no logserver exists, it will be necessary for each system to run

    Logwatch individually. Using a central logserver provides the security and

    reliability benefits discussed earlier, and also makes monitoring logs

    easier and less time-intensive for administrators.'

description: 'Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) is a hardware vulnerability which
    allows unprivileged

    speculative access to data which is available in various CPU internal buffers.


    When performing store, load, L1 refill operations, processors write data into
    temporary

    microarchitectural structures (buffers), and the data in the buffer can be forwarded
    to load

    operations as an optimization.


    Under certain conditions, data unrelated to the load operations can be speculatively

    forwarded from the buffers to a disclosure gadget which allows in turn to infer
    the value

    via a cache side channel attack.


    Select the appropriate mitigation by adding the argument

    <tt>mds=<sub idref="var_mds_options" /></tt> to the default

    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    Configure the default Grub2 kernel command line to contain mds=<sub idref="var_mds_options"
    /> as follows:

    <pre># grub2-editenv - set "$(grub2-editenv - list | grep kernelopts) mds=<sub
    idref="var_mds_options" />"</pre>


    Not all processors are affected by all variants of MDS, but the mitigation mechanism
    is

    identical for all of them.


    Since Linux Kernel 5.2 you can check whether the system is vulnerable or mitigated
    with the

    following command:

    <tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds</tt>'
rationale: The MDS vulnerability allows an attacker to sample data from internal CPU
    buffers.

description: "Generate a warning if any W+X mappings are found at boot.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 5.8.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_WX</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_DEBUG_WX\
    \ /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value\
    \ \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'This is useful for discovering cases where the kernel is leaving W+X mappings
    after applying NX,

    as such mappings are a security risk.

    Note that even if the check fails, your kernel is possibly still fine, as W+X
    mappings are not

    a security hole in themselves, what they do is that they make the exploitation
    of other unfixed

    kernel bugs easier.'

description: "This config disables the vsyscall mapping at all. Attempts to use the\
    \ vsyscalls will be reported to\ndmesg, so that either old or malicious userspace\
    \ programs can be identified.\nThis configuration is available from kernel 4.4.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This will eliminate any risk of ASLR bypass due to the vsyscall fixed address
    mapping.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

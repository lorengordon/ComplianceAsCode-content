description: 'By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests, which
    require

    credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS clients send

    credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few clients that

    do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the client to

    only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the

    <tt>insecure_locks</tt> option can be used so these clients can access the

    desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the

    client access to data for which it does not have authorization. Remove any

    instances of the <tt>insecure_locks</tt> option from the file

    <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.'
rationale: 'Allowing insecure file locking could allow for sensitive data to be

    viewed or edited by an unauthorized user.'

description: 'Logging of remote access methods must be implemented to help identify
    cyber

    attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies are being

    audited and upheld. An examples of a remote access method is the use of the

    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from an external, non-organization controlled

    network. The <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> or

    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt> file should contain a match for the following

    selectors: <tt>auth.*</tt>, <tt>authpriv.*</tt>, and <tt>daemon.*</tt>. If

    not, use the following as an example configuration:

    <pre>auth.*;authpriv.*;daemon.*                              /var/log/secure</pre>'
rationale: 'Logging remote access methods can be used to trace the decrease the risks

    associated with remote user access management. It can also be used to spot

    cyber attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with organizational policies

    surrounding the use of remote access methods.'

        vuldiscussion: 'The USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard
            software framework. It runs as a service in the background and enforces
            the USB device authorization policy for all USB devices. The policy is
            defined by a set of rules using a rule language described in the usbguard-rules.conf
            file. The policy and the authorization state of USB devices can be modified
            during runtime using the usbguard tool.


            The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System
            Security Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals
            and establish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only
            authorized devices.'

            If usbguard is not active, ask the SA to indicate how unauthorized peripherals
            are being blocked.

            If there is no evidence that unauthorized peripherals are being blocked
            before establishing a connection, this is a finding.'

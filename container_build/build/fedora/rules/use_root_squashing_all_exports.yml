description: 'If a filesystem is exported using root squashing, requests from root
    on the client

    are considered to be unprivileged (mapped to a user such as nobody). This provides
    some mild

    protection against remote abuse of an NFS server. Root squashing is enabled by
    default, and

    should not be disabled.

    <br /><br />

    Ensure that no line in <tt>/etc/exports</tt> contains the option <tt>no_root_squash</tt>.'
rationale: 'If the NFS server allows root access to local file systems from remote
    hosts, this

    access could be used to compromise the system.'

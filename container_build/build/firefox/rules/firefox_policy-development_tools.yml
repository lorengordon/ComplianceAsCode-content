description: "Firefox provides development tools which identify detailed information\
    \ \nabout the browser and its configuration. These details are often also \nrecorded\
    \ into a log file, giving an attacker the ability to capture \ndetailed information\
    \ about the system.\nThis can be disabled by setting <tt>DisableDeveloperTools</tt>\
    \ to\n<tt>true</tt> in <tt>policies.json</tt>"
rationale: 'In order to protect privacy and sensitive data, Mozilla provides

    the ability to configure Firefox so that development tools are prevented from
    being used.'

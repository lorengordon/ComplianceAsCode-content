description: 'DNS over HTTPS feature may be disabled via administrative policy by
    setting

    <tt>Enabled</tt> under <tt>DNSOverHTTPS</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.'
rationale: 'DNS over HTTPS has generally not been adopted in the DoD. DNS is tightly
    controlled.

    It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality
    exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or
    services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase
    the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

    Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.
    Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary
    to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).

    Examples of non-essential capabilities include but are not limited to advertising
    software or browser plug-ins that are not related to requirements or provide a
    wide array of functionality not required for every mission but that cannot be
    disabled.'

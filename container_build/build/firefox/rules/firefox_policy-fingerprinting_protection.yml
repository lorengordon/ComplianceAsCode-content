description: 'Fingerprinting protection may be enabled by setting

    <tt>Fingerprinting</tt> to <tt>true</tt> under <tt>EnableTrackingProtection</tt>

    in the policies file.'
rationale: 'The Content Blocking/Tracking Protection feature stops Firefox from loading
    content from malicious sites. The content might be a script or an image, for example.
    If a site is on one of the tracker lists you set Firefox to use, then the fingerprinting
    script (or other tracking script/image) will not be loaded from that site.

    Fingerprinting scripts collect information about your browser and device configuration,
    such as your operating system, screen resolution, and other settings. By compiling
    these pieces of data, fingerprinters create a unique profile of you that can be
    used to track you around the Web.'

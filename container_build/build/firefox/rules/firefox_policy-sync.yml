description: 'Firefox accounts feature may be disabled via administrative policy by
    setting

    <tt>DisableFirefoxAccounts</tt> under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.'
rationale: "Disable Firefox Accounts integration (Sync). \nIt is detrimental for applications\
    \ to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission\
    \ objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked\
    \ and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by\
    \ providing additional attack vectors.\nApplications are capable of providing\
    \ a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services,\
    \ provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational\
    \ operations (e.g., key missions, functions).\nExamples of non-essential capabilities\
    \ include but are not limited to advertising software or browser plug-ins that\
    \ are not related to requirements or provide a wide array of functionality not\
    \ required for every mission but that cannot be disabled."

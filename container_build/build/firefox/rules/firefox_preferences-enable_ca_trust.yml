description: 'The Shared System Certificates store makes NSS, GnuTLS, OpenSSL, and
    Java

    share a default source for retrieving system certificate anchors and blacklist

    information. Firefox has the capability of using this centralized store for its

    CA certificates. If the Shared System Certificates store is disabled, it can

    be enabled by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo update-ca-trust enable</pre>'
rationale: 'The DOD root certificate will ensure that the trust chain is

    established for server certificates issued from the DOD CA.'

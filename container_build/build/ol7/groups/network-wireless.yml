description: "Wireless networking, such as 802.11\n(WiFi) and Bluetooth, can present\
    \ a security risk to sensitive or\nclassified systems and networks. Wireless networking\
    \ hardware is\nmuch more likely to be included in laptop or portable systems than\n\
    in desktops or servers. \n<br /><br />\nRemoval of hardware provides the greatest\
    \ assurance that the wireless\ncapability remains disabled. Acquisition policies\
    \ often include provisions to\nprevent the purchase of equipment that will be\
    \ used in sensitive spaces and\nincludes wireless capabilities. If it is impractical\
    \ to remove the wireless\nhardware, and policy permits the device to enter sensitive\
    \ spaces as long\nas wireless is disabled, efforts should instead focus on disabling\
    \ wireless capability\nvia software."

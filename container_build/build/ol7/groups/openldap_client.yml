description: "This section provides information on which security settings are\nimportant\
    \ to configure in OpenLDAP clients by manually editing the appropriate\nconfiguration\
    \ files.  Oracle Linux 7 provides an automated configuration tool called\nauthconfig\
    \ and a graphical wrapper for authconfig called\n<tt>system-config-authentication</tt>.\
    \ However, these tools do not provide as\nmuch control over configuration as manual\
    \ editing of configuration files. The\nauthconfig tools do not allow you to specify\
    \ locations of SSL certificate\nfiles, which is useful when trying to use SSL\
    \ cleanly across several protocols.\nInstallation and configuration of OpenLDAP\
    \ on Oracle Linux 7 is available at\n\n    \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\

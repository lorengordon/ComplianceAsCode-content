description: 'When properly configured, the Samba service allows

    Linux systems to provide file and print sharing to Microsoft

    Windows systems. There are two software packages that provide

    Samba support. The first, <tt>samba-client</tt>, provides a series of

    command line tools that enable a client system to access Samba

    shares. The second, simply labeled <tt>samba</tt>, provides the Samba

    service. It is this second package that allows a Linux system to

    act as an Active Directory server, a domain controller, or as a

    domain member. Only the <tt>samba-client</tt> package is installed by

    default.'

description: Change user IDs (UIDs), or delete accounts, so each has a unique name.
rationale: To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, interactive
    users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise
    of the system.

    Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization
    deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational
    users (and processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and
    authenticated to all accesses, except for the following:

    1) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations
    document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system
    without identification or authentication; and

    2) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without
    individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of
    individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed
    accountability of individual activity.'

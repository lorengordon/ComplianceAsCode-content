description: 'By default, the <tt>sha512</tt> option is added to the <tt>NORMAL</tt>
    ruleset in AIDE.

    If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>sha512</tt> option is missing, add <tt>sha512</tt>

    to the appropriate ruleset.

    For example, add <tt>sha512</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:

    <pre>NORMAL = FIPSR+sha512</pre>

    AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that
    is already

    configured by default.'
rationale: 'File integrity tools use cryptographic hashes for verifying file contents
    and directories

    have not been altered. These hashes must be FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic
    hashes.'

-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

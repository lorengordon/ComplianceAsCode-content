description: 'The <tt>openat</tt> syscall can be used to create new files

    when O_CREAT flag is specified.


    The following audit rules will assure that successful attempts to create a

    file via <tt>openat</tt> syscall are collected.


    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt>

    program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the

    rules below to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory

    <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.


    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the rules below to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.


    <pre>

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -F a2&amp;0100 -F success=1 -F auid>=1000
    -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-create

    </pre>


    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

    <pre>

    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F a2&amp;0100 -F success=1 -F auid>=1000
    -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-create

    </pre>'
rationale: 'Successful attempts to access files could be an indicator of malicious
    activity on a system. Auditing

    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.'

        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping system calls
        related

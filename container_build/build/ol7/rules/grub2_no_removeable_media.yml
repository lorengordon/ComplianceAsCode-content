description: 'The system must not allow removable media to be used as the boot loader.

    Remove alternate methods of booting the system from removable media.

    <tt>usb0</tt>, <tt>cd</tt>, <tt>fd0</tt>, etc. are some examples of removeable

    media which should not exist in the lines:

    <pre>set root=''hd0,msdos1''</pre>'
rationale: 'Malicious users with removable boot media can gain access to a system

    configured to use removable media as the boot loader.'

ocil: 'To verify the system is not configured to use a boot loader on removable media,

    check that the grub configuration file has the set root command in each menu

    entry with the following commands:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -cw menuentry /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>

    Note that the <pre>-c</pre> option for the <pre>grep</pre> command will print

    only the count of <pre>menuentry</pre> occurrences. This number should match

    the number of occurrences reported by the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep "set root=''hd0" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>

    The output should return something similar to:

    <pre>set root=''hd0,msdos1''</pre>

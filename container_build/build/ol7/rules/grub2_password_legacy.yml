description: 'The grub2 boot loader should have a superuser account and password

    protection enabled to protect boot-time settings.

    <br /><br />

    Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate an encrypted grub2 password

    for the grub superusers with the following command:

    <pre>$ grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</pre>

    When prompted, enter the password that was selected.

    <br /><br />

    Using the hash from the output, modify the <tt>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</tt>

    file with the following content:

    <pre>set superusers="root"

    password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.VeryLongString

    </pre>

    Once the superuser password has been added, update the

    <tt>grub.cfg</tt> file by running:

    <pre>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>'
rationale: 'Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures

    users with physical access cannot trivially alter

    important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,

    and whether to enter single-user mode.'

description: 'To disable use of virtual syscalls,

    add the argument <tt>vsyscall=none</tt> to the default

    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    To ensure that <tt>vsyscall=none</tt> is added as a kernel command line

    argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>vsyscall=none</tt> to the

    default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:

    command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.

    Run the following command:

    The command should not return any output.'

        srg_requirement: Oracle Linux 7 must disable virtual syscalls.
        vuldiscussion: 'Syscalls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace
            applications ask to do privileged tasks.  Invoking a system call is an
            expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently
            executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace
            after the system call completes.  Virtual Syscalls map into user space
            a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system
            calls.  This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate
            the context switching expense.


            Virtual Syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control
            of the return instruction pointer.  Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent
            return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns.
            If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then
            virtual syscalls will need enabled so the components function properly.'

            the following command:

            If any output is returned, this is a finding.


            Check that vsyscalls are disabled by default to persist in kernel updates

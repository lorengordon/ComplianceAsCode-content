description: 'The package <tt>glibc</tt> is installed on Linux by default, but the

    <tt>glibc</tt> version might not be sufficient for SAP. Please refer to

    SAP note of your Linux version for the minimum requirement on <tt>glibc</tt>.

    The <code>glibc</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum install glibc</pre>'
rationale: 'The <tt>glibc</tt> package contains standard C and math libraries used
    by

    multiple programs on Linux. The <tt>glibc</tt> shipped with first release

    of each major Linux version is often not sufficient for SAP.

    An update is required after the first OS installation.'

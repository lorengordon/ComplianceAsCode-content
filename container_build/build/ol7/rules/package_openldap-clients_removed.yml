description: 'The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a service that provides

    a method for looking up information from a central database.

    The <code>openldap-clients</code> package can be removed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum erase openldap-clients</pre>'
rationale: If the system does not need to act as an LDAP client, it is recommended
    that the software is removed to reduce the potential attack surface.

description: 'It is recommended that the <tt>/opt</tt> directory resides on a separate

    partition.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/opt</tt> partition contains additional software, usually installed

    outside the packaging system. Putting this directory on a separate partition

    makes it easier to apply restrictions e.g. through the <tt>nosuid</tt> mount

    option.'

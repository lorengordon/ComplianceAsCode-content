description: 'A proxy server is a very desirable target for a

    potential adversary because much (or all) sensitive data for a

    given infrastructure may flow through it. Therefore, if one is

    required, the system acting as a proxy server should be dedicated

    to that purpose alone and be stored in a physically secure

    location. The system''s default proxy server software is Squid, and

    provided in an RPM package of the same name.'

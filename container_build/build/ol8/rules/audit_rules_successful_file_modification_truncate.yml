description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect unauthorized file

    accesses for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured

    to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon

    startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:


    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S truncate -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=successful-access</pre>


    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S truncate -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=successful-access</pre>


    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S truncate -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=successful-access</pre>


    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S truncate -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=successful-access</pre>'
rationale: 'File access attempts could be an indicator of malicious activity on a
    system. Auditing

    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.'

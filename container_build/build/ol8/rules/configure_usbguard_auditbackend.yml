        vuldiscussion: 'Without the capability to generate audit records, it would
            be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating
            to an incident or identify those responsible for one.


            If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some
            startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain
            state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given
            process is created.


            Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
            system (e.g., module or policy filter).


            The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to
            be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of
            all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.


            DoD has defined the list of events for which Oracle Linux 8 will provide
            an audit record generation capability as the following:


            1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges,
            security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g.,
            classification levels);


            2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts,
            privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending
            time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations,
            successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations,
            and all direct access to the information system;


            3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations;
            and


            4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.'

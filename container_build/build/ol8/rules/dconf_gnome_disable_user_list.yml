description: 'In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the

    system are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users.

    This functionality should be disabled by setting <tt>disable-user-list</tt>

    to <tt>true</tt>.

    <br /><br />

    To disable, add or edit <tt>disable-user-list</tt> to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

    disable-user-list=true</pre>

    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent

    user modification. For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-user-list</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone

    with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user accounts

    without logging in.'

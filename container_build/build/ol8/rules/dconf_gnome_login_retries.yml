description: 'In the default graphical environment, the GNOME3 login

    screen and be configured to restart the authentication process after

    a configured number of attempts. This can be configured by setting

    <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to <tt>3</tt> or less.

    <br /><br />

    To enable, add or edit <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

    allowed-failures=3</pre>

    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user
    modification.

    For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/allowed-failures</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session
    basis to a low value

    requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and

    draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks.'

    To ensure that users cannot change or configure the resets after a specified

    number of failures on the login screen, run the following:

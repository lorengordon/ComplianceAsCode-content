description: 'To configure the system to notify users of last logon/access

    using <tt>pam_lastlog</tt>, add or correct the <tt>pam_lastlog</tt>

    settings in

    <tt>/etc/pam.d/postlogin</tt> to read as follows:

    <pre>session     required pam_lastlog.so showfailed</pre>

    And make sure that the <tt>silent</tt> option is not set for

    <tt>pam_lastlog</tt> module.'
rationale: 'Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding

    their account. Providing users with information regarding the number

    of unsuccessful attempts that were made to login to their account

    allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred

    and gives them an opportunity to notify administrators.'

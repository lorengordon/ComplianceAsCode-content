description: The Fapolicy module must be configured to employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception
    policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs and to prevent unauthorized
    software from running.
rationale: 'Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing
    the execution of only authorized software.

    Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential
    vulnerabilities. Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution
    or at system startup.


    Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon.

    Improper configuration may render the system non-functional.

    The "fapolicyd" API is not namespace aware and can cause issues when launching
    or running containers.'

    whitelisting policy with "fapolicyd".


    With the "fapolicyd" installed and enabled, configure the daemon to function in
    permissive mode until the whitelist is built correctly to avoid system lockout.
    Do this by editing the "/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf" file with the following
    line:


    permissive = 1

    For OL 8.5 systems and older:

    Build the whitelist in the "/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.rules" file ensuring the
    last rule is "deny perm=any all : all".


    For OL 8.6 systems and newer:

    Build the whitelist in a file within the "/etc/fapolicyd/rules.d" directory ensuring
    the last rule is "deny perm=any all : all".


    Once it is determined the whitelist is built correctly, set the fapolicyd to enforcing
    mode by editing the "permissive" line in the /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf file.

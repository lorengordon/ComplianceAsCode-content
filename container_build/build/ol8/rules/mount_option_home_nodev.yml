description: 'The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option can be used to prevent device files
    from

    being created in <tt>/home</tt>.

    Legitimate character and block devices should exist only in

    the <tt>/dev</tt> directory on the root partition or within chroot

    jails built for system services.

    Add the <code>nodev</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/home</code>.'
rationale: 'The only legitimate location for device files is the <tt>/dev</tt> directory

    located on the root partition. The only exception to this is chroot jails.'

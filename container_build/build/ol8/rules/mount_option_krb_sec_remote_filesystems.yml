description: 'Add the <code>sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p</code> option to the fourth column
    of <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    any NFS mounts.'
rationale: 'When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS a selected userid and
    groupid are used to handle

    requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously
    be set

    incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server
    and client

    systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.'

        srg_requirement: Oracle Linux 8 must be configured so that the Network File
            System (NFS) is configured to use RPCSEC_GSS.
        vuldiscussion: When an NFS server is configured to use RPCSEC_SYS, a selected
            userid and groupid are used to handle requests from the remote user. The
            userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously be set incorrectly.
            The RPCSEC_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server
            and client systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.
        checktext: 'Verify Oracle Linux 8 has the "sec" option configured for all
            NFS mounts with the following command:


            $ cat /etc/fstab | grep nfs


            192.168.22.2:/mnt/export /data nfs4 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,sync,soft,sec=krb5p:krb5i:krb5


            If no NFS mounts are configured this requirement is not applicable.


            If the system is mounting file systems via NFS and has the sec option
            without the "krb5:krb5i:krb5p" settings, the "sec" option has the "sys"
            setting, or the "sec" option is missing, this is a finding.'
        fixtext: Update each NFS mounted file system to use the "sec" option with
            flavors defined as "krb5p:krb5i:krb5".

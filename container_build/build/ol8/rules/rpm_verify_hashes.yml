description: 'Without cryptographic integrity protections, system

    executables and files can be altered by unauthorized users without

    detection.

    The RPM package management system can check the hashes of

    installed software packages, including many that are important to system

    security.

    To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor

    values, run the following command to list which files on the system

    have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:

    <pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep ''^..5''</pre>

    A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which

    may appropriately be expected to change. If the file was not expected to

    change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.

    The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.

    Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:

    <pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

    The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:

    <pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

    Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:

    <pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>'
rationale: 'The hashes of important files like system executables should match the

    information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could

    be a sign of nefarious activity on the system.'

description: 'Rsyslogd is a system utility providing support for message logging.
    Support

    for both internet and UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both
    local

    and remote logging.  Couple this utility with <tt>gnutls</tt> (which is a secure
    communications

    library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
    securely

    encrypt and off-load auditing.


    When using <tt>rsyslogd</tt> to off-load logs off a encrpytion system must be
    used.'
rationale: 'The audit records generated by Rsyslog contain valuable information regarding
    system

    configuration, user authentication, and other such information. Audit records
    should be

    protected from unauthorized access.'

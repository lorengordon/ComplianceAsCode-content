description: 'Verify the SSH private key files have a passcode.

    For each private key stored on the system, use the following command:


    <pre>$ sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/file</pre>


    If the contents of the key are displayed, without asking a passphrase this is
    a finding.'
rationale: 'If an unauthorized user obtains access to a private key without a passcode,
    that user would

    have unauthorized access to any system where the associated public key has been
    installed.'

description: 'The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic

    through the connection to enable remote graphic connections.

    SSH has the capability to encrypt remote X11 connections when SSH''s

    <tt>X11Forwarding</tt> option is enabled.

    <br />

    The default SSH configuration disables X11Forwarding. The appropriate

    configuration is used if no value is set for <tt>X11Forwarding</tt>.

    <br />

    To explicitly disable X11 Forwarding, add or correct the following line in



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>X11Forwarding no</pre>'
rationale: 'Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use
    X11

    applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of

    users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by

    other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled,

    users can always install their own forwarders.'

        vuldiscussion: When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure
            to the server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured
            to listen on the wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the forwarding
            server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the DIPSLAY
            environment variable to localhost.  This prevents remote hosts from connecting
            to the proxy display.

description: 'Do not allow users to reuse recent passwords. This can be accomplished
    by using the

    <tt>remember</tt> option for the <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> PAM module.

    <br/><br/>


    On systems with newer versions of <tt>authselect</tt>, the <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt>
    PAM module

    can be enabled via authselect feature:

    <pre>authselect enable-feature with-pwhistory</pre>


    Otherwise, it should be enabled using an authselect custom profile.

    <br/><br/>

    Newer systems also have the <tt>/etc/security/pwhistory.conf</tt> file for setting

    <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> module options. This file should be used whenever available.

    Otherwise, the <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> module options can be set in PAM files.

    <br/><br/>

    The value for <tt>remember</tt> option must be equal or greater than

    <sub idref="var_password_pam_remember" />'
rationale: 'Preventing re-use of previous passwords helps ensure that a compromised
    password is not

    re-used by a user.'

description: 'If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

    default), add the following line to to the bottom of a file with suffix

    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-f <sub idref="var_audit_failure_mode" /></pre>

rationale: 'It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system

    is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this

    notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of

    the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.

    <br /><br />

    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the

    audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or

    exceeded.'

description: 'In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the

    system are greeted with a login screen that allows any user, known or

    unknown, the ability the ability to shutdown or restart the system. This

    functionality should be disabled by setting

    <tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

    <br /><br />

    To disable, add or edit <tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

    disable-restart-buttons=true</pre>

    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent

    user modification. For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-restart-buttons</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'A user who is at the console can reboot the system at the login screen.
    If restart or shutdown buttons

    are pressed at the login screen, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
    availability of systems

    due to reboot.'

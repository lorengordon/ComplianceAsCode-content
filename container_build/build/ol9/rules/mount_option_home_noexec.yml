description: 'The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries from
    being

    executed out of <tt>/home</tt>.

    Add the <code>noexec</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/home</code>.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/home</tt> directory contains data of individual users. Binaries
    in

    this directory should not be considered as trusted and users should not be

    able to execute them.'

warnings:
-   functionality: 'OVAL looks for partitions whose mount point is a substring of
        any interactive user''s home

        directory and validates that noexec option is there. Because of this, there
        could be false

        negatives when several partitions share a base substring. For example, if
        there is a home

        directory in <tt>/var/tmp/user1</tt> and there are partitions mounted in <tt>/var</tt>
        and

        <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The noexec option is only expected in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>,
        but OVAL will

        check both.<br/>

        Bash remediation uses the <tt>df</tt> command to find out the partition where
        the home

        directory is mounted. However, if the directory doesn''t exist the remediation
        won''t be

        applied.'

        srg_requirement: Oracle Linux 9 must prevent code from being executed on file

        vuldiscussion: The "noexec" mount option causes the system to not execute
            binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not
            containing approved binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing
            files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged
            users to attain unauthorized administrative access.

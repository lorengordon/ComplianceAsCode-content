description: 'The SSH daemon should prevent remote hosts from connecting to the proxy

    display.

    <br />

    The default SSH configuration for <tt>X11UseLocalhost</tt> is <tt>yes</tt>,

    which prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.

    <br />

    To explicitly prevent remote connections to the proxy display, add or correct

    the following line in



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <tt>X11UseLocalhost yes</tt>'
rationale: 'When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional exposure to the

    server and client displays if the sshd proxy display is configured to listen

    on the wildcard address. By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the

    loopback address and sets the hostname part of the <tt>DISPLAY</tt>

    environment variable to localhost. This prevents remote hosts from

    connecting to the proxy display.'

description: 'The sudo <tt>timestamp_timeout</tt> tag sets the amount of time sudo
    password prompt waits.

    The default <tt>timestamp_timeout</tt> value is 5 minutes.

    The timestamp_timeout should be configured by making sure that the

    <tt>timestamp_timeout</tt> tag exists in

    <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> configuration file or any sudo configuration snippets

    in <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt>.

    If the value is set to an integer less than 0, the user''s time stamp will not
    expire

    and the user will not have to re-authenticate for privileged actions until the
    user''s session is terminated.'
rationale: 'Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks
    for which they

    do not have authorization.

    <br /><br />

    When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability,
    it

    is critical that the user re-authenticate.'

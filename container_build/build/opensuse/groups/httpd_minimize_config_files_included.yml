description: 'The <tt>Include</tt> directive directs <tt>httpd</tt> to load supplementary
    configuration files

    from a provided path. The default configuration loads all files that end in <tt>.conf</tt>

    from the <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d</tt> directory.

    <br /><br />

    To restrict excess configuration, the following line should be commented out and

    replaced with <tt>Include</tt> directives that only reference required configuration
    files:

    <pre>#Include conf.d/*.conf</pre>

    If the above change was made, ensure that the SSL encryption remains loaded by

    explicitly including the corresponding configuration file:

    <pre>Include conf.d/ssl.conf</pre>

    If PHP is necessary, a similar alteration must be made:

    <pre>Include conf.d/php.conf</pre>


    Explicitly listing the configuration files to be loaded during web server start-up
    avoids

    the possibility of unwanted or malicious configuration files to be automatically
    included as

    part of the server''s running configuration.'

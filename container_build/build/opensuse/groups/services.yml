description: 'The best protection against vulnerable software is running less software.
    This section describes how to review

    the software which openSUSE installs on a system and disable software which is
    not needed. It

    then enumerates the software packages installed on a default openSUSE system and
    provides guidance about which

    ones can be safely disabled.

    <br /><br />

    openSUSE provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially installs
    the bare necessities for a functional

    system. When building openSUSE systems, it is highly recommended to select the
    minimal packages and then build up

    the system from there.'

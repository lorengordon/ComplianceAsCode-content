description: 'System-wide shared library directories, which contain are linked to
    executables

    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

    by default:

    <pre>/lib

    /lib64

    /usr/lib

    /usr/lib64

    </pre>

    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are

    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All sub-directories in these directories

    should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these

    directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct

    its permission with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>DIR</i></pre>'
rationale: 'If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software
    libraries,

    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing

    and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.


    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are
    accessible

    and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries
    also include

    privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and
    authorized

    individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components
    for purposes

    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'

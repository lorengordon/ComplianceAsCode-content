description: 'The system includes support for several network protocols which are
    not commonly used.

    Although security vulnerabilities in kernel networking code are not frequently
    discovered,

    the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon network protocols are disabled

    reduces the system''s risk to attacks targeted at its implementation of those
    protocols.'
warnings:
-   general: 'Although these protocols are not commonly used, avoid disruption

        in your network environment by ensuring they are not needed

        prior to disabling them.'

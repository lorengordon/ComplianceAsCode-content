description: 'The <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer is used to implement

    automatic session locking. It should be started from

    <tt>/etc/bashrc</tt> or drop-in files within <tt>/etc/profile.d/</tt>.'
rationale: 'Unlike <tt>bash</tt> itself, the <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer

    provides a mechanism to lock sessions after period of inactivity.

    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away
    from the

    immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to

    log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.'

            the absence.


            The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can
            be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire
            before the user session can be locked, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS
            4 must provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock
            so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate
            the immediate physical vicinity.


            The "tmux" package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
            However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The "tmux"
            default configuration does not contain an effective session lock.'

description: 'By default, inbound connections to SSH''s port are allowed. If the SSH

    server is not being used, this exception should be removed from the

    firewall configuration.

    <br /><br />

    Edit the files <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use). In each file, locate

    and delete the line:

    <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</pre>

    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated

    remote access.'
rationale: 'If inbound SSH connections are not expected, disallowing access to the
    SSH

    port will avoid possible exploitation of the port by an attacker.'

description: 'Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and
    exist to

    perform some administrative function. Should an attacker be able to log into

    these accounts, they should not be granted access to a shell.

    <br /><br />

    The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of each line

    in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID

    less than UID_MIN, where value of UID_MIN directive is set in

    /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default configuration UID_MIN is set

    to 1000, thus system accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than

    1000. The user ID is stored in the third field. If any system account

    <i>SYSACCT</i> (other than root) has a login shell, disable it with the

    command: <pre>$ sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin <i>SYSACCT</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more

    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.'

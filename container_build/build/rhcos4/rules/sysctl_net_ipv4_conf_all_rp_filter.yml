description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter</code>
    kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1</pre>

    To make sure that the setting is persistent, add the following line to a file
    in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>: <pre>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1</pre>'
rationale: 'Enabling reverse path filtering drops packets with source addresses

    that should not have been able to be received on the interface they were

    received on. It should not be used on systems which are routers for

    complicated networks, but is helpful for end hosts and routers serving small

    networks.'

ocil: 'The runtime status of the <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter</code> parameter
    can be queried

    by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter</pre>

    The output of the command should indicate either:

    <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1</code>

    or:

    <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2</code>

    The output of the command should not indicate:

    <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0</code>


    The preferable way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have

    correct persistent configuration, and rebooting the system.


    The persistent sysctl parameter configuration is performed by specifying the appropriate

    assignment in any file located in the <pre>/etc/sysctl.d</pre> directory.

    Verify that there is not any existing incorrect configuration by executing the
    following command:

    <pre>$ grep -r ''^\s*net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter\s*='' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>

    The command should not find any assignments other than:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

    or:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2


    Conflicting assignments are not allowed.'

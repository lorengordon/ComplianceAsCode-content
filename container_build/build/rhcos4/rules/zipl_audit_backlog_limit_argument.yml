description: 'To improve the kernel capacity to queue all log events, even those which
    start prior to the audit daemon,

    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>audit_backlog_limit=8192</tt>

    included in its options.<br />

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to extend the audit log events
    queue,

    add <tt>audit_backlog_limit=8192</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.'
rationale: 'audit_backlog_limit sets the queue length for audit events awaiting transfer

    to the audit daemon. Until the audit daemon is up and running, all log messages

    are stored in this queue.  If the queue is overrun during boot process, the action

    defined by audit failure flag is taken.'

    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that does not extend

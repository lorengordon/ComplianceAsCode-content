    options are available:

    <br />ignore - audit daemon does nothing.

    <br />syslog - audit daemon will issue a warning to syslog.

    <br />suspend - audit daemon will stop writing records to the disk.

    <br />rotate - audit daemon will rotate logs in the same convention used by logrotate.

    <br />keep_logs - similar to rotate but prevents audit logs to be overwritten.

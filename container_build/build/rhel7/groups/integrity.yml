description: 'System and software integrity can be gained by installing antivirus,
    increasing

    system encryption strength with FIPS, verifying installed software, enabling SELinux,

    installing an Intrusion Prevention System, etc. However, installing or enabling
    integrity

    checking tools cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions, but they can detect that an intrusion

    may have occurred. Requirements for integrity checking may be highly dependent
    on

    the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based approaches such

    as AIDE may induce considerable overhead in the presence of frequent software
    updates.'

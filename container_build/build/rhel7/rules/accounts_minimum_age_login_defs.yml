description: 'To specify password minimum age for new accounts,

    edit the file <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>

    and add or correct the following line:

    <pre>PASS_MIN_DAYS <sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs" /></pre>

    A value of 1 day is considered sufficient for many

    environments. The DoD requirement is 1.

    The profile requirement is <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs"
    /></tt>.'
rationale: 'Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password

    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If

    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password,

    then the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to

    defeat the organization''s policy regarding password reuse.

    <br /><br />

    Setting the minimum password age protects against users cycling back to a

    favorite password after satisfying the password reuse requirement.'

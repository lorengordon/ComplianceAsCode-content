description: 'Do not allow users to reuse recent passwords. This can be accomplished
    by using the

    <tt>remember</tt> option for the <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> PAM module.

    <br/><br/>


    In the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt>, make sure the parameter <tt>remember</tt>
    is

    present and it has a value equal to or greater than

    <sub idref="var_password_pam_remember" />

    <br/><br/>

    For example:

    <pre>password <sub idref="var_password_pam_remember_control_flag" /> pam_pwhistory.so
    use_authtok remember=<sub idref="var_password_pam_remember" /></pre>'
rationale: 'Preventing re-use of previous passwords helps ensure that a compromised
    password is not

    re-used by a user.'

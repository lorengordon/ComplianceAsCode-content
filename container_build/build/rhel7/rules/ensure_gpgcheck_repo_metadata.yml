description: 'Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches,

    service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of

    local packages without verification of the repository metadata.

    Check that <tt>yum</tt> verifies the repository

    metadata prior to install with the following command.

    This should be configured by setting <tt>repo_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt>

    in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt>.'
rationale: 'Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the

    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the

    software has not been tampered and has been provided by a trusted vendor.

    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system

    components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by

    the organization. Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to

    installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from

    a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it

    has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are

    disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have

    to verify the software again. NOTE: For U.S. Military systems, this

    requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,

    the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved

    Certificate Authority.'

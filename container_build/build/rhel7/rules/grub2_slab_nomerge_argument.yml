description: 'The kernel may merge similar slabs together to reduce overhead and increase

    cache hotness of objects.

    Disabling merging of slabs keeps the slabs separate and reduces the risk of

    kernel heap overflows overwriting objects in merged caches.


    To disable merging of slabs in the Kernel add the argument <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt>

    to the default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    To ensure that <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt> is added as a kernel command line

    argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt> to the

    default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:

    <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... slab_nomerge=yes ..."</pre>

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre>#
    grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="slab_nomerge=yes"</pre>'
rationale: 'Disabling the merge of slabs of similar sizes prevents the kernel from

    merging a seemingly useless but vulnerable slab with a useful and valuable slab.

    This increase the risk that a heap overflow could overwrite objects from merged
    caches,

    with unmerged caches the heap overflow would only affect the objects in the same
    cache.

    Overall, this reduces the kernel attack surface area by isolating slabs from each
    other.'

ocil_clause: merging of slabs with similar size is enabled
ocil: 'Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system

    in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. If it includes <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt>,

    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.

    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*slab_nomerge=yes.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*slab_nomerge=yes.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>.Moreover,
    command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.

    Run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v ''slab_nomerge=yes''</pre>

    The command should not return any output.'

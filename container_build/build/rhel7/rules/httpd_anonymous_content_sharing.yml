description: 'Web content directories should not be shared anonymously over remote
    filesystems

    such as <tt>nfs</tt> and <tt>smb</tt>. Remove the shares from the applicable

    directories.'
rationale: 'Sharing web content is a security risk when a web server is involved.
    Users

    accessing the share anonymously could experience privileged access to the

    content of such directories. Network sharable directories expose those

    directories and their contents to unnecessary access. Any unnecessary exposure

    increases the risk that someone could exploit that access and either compromises

    the web content or cause web server performance problems.'

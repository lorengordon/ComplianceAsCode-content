description: 'If the <tt>mod_perl</tt> module is installed, enable Perl Taint checking
    in

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>. To enable Perl Taint

    checking, add or uncomment the following to <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf</tt>:

    <pre>PerlSwitches -T</pre>'
rationale: 'PERL (Practical Extraction and Report Language) is an interpreted language

    optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those

    text files, and printing reports based on that information. The language is

    often used in shell scripting and is intended to be practical, easy to use, and

    efficient means of generating interactive web pages for the user. Unfortunately,

    many widely available freeware PERL programs (scripts) are extremely insecure.

    This is most readily accomplished by a malicious user substituting input to a

    PERL script during a POST or a GET operation.

    <br /><br />

    Consequently, the founders of

    PERL have developed a mechanism named TAINT that protects the system from

    malicious input sent from outside the program. When the data is tainted, it

    cannot be used in programs or functions such as eval(), system(), exec(), pipes,

    or popen(). The script will exit with a warning message.'

description: 'If any directories that contain dynamic scripts can be accessed via
    FTP by

    any group or user that does not require access, remove permissions to such

    directories that allow anonymous access. Also, ensure that any such

    access employs an encrypted connection.'
rationale: 'The directories containing the CGI scripts, such as PERL, must not be

    accessible to anonymous users via FTP. This applies to all directories that

    contain scripts that can dynamically produce web pages in an interactive manner

    (i.e., scripts based upon user-provided input). Such scripts contain information

    that could be used to compromise a web service, access system resources, or

    deface a web site.'

    on the directories using the following command:

    <pre>ls -l <i>directories</i></pre>

    Anonymous FTP users must not have access to these directories.'

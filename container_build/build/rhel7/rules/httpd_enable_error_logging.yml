description: '<tt>ErrorLog</tt> should be enabled and set to the following in

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:

    <pre>ErrorLog "logs/error_log"</pre>'
rationale: 'The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to
    identify

    potential problems and enable proactive remediation. Log data can reveal

    anomalous behavior such as "not found" or "unauthorized" errors that may

    be an evidence of attack attempts. Failure to enable error logging can

    significantly reduce the ability of Web Administrators to detect or remediate

    problems.'

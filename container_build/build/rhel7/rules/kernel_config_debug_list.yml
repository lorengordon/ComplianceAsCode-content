description: "Enable this to turn on extended checks in the linked-list walking routines.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST</tt>, run the\
    \ following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST /boot/config-*</tt>\n   \
    \ \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'This add sanity checks to manipulation of linked lists structures in the
    kernel and may

    prevent exploits such as CVE-2017-1661, where a race condition and simultaneos
    operations

    caused a list to corrupt.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

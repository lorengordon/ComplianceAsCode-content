description: "This enables support for LSM module Yama, which extends DAC support\
    \ with additional system-wide\nsecurity settings beyond regular Linux discretionary\
    \ access controls. The module will limit the\nuse of the system call <tt>ptrace()</tt>.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA</tt>, run the\
    \ following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'Unrestricted usage of ptrace allows compromised binaries to run ptrace

    on another processes of the user.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

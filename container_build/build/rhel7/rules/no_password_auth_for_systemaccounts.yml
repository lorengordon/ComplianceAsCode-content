description: 'Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and
    exist to

    perform some administrative function. An attacker should not be able to log into

    these accounts.

    <br /><br />

    System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID

    less than UID_MIN, where value of the UID_MIN directive is set in

    <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> configuration file. In the default configuration UID_MIN
    is set

    to 500, thus system accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than

    500. If any system account <i>SYSACCT</i> (other than root) has an unlocked password,

    disable it with the command:

    <pre>$ sudo passwd -l <i>SYSACCT</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Disabling authentication for default system accounts makes it more difficult

    for attackers to make use of them to compromise a system.false'

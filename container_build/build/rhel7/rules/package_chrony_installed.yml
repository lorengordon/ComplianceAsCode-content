description: 'System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment.
    This is

    typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers
    and having all

    systems synchronize their clocks to them.

    The <code>chrony</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum install chrony</pre>'
rationale: 'Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms
    like

    Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,

    which aids in forensic investigations.'

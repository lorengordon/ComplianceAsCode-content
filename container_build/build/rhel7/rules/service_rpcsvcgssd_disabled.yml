description: 'The rpcsvcgssd service manages RPCSEC GSS contexts required to

    secure protocols that use RPC (most often Kerberos and NFS). The rpcsvcgssd

    service is the server-side of RPCSEC GSS. If the system does not require secure

    RPC then this service should be disabled.


    The <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now rpcsvcgssd.service</pre>'
rationale: Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface
    of the system.

    cce: CCE-80238-9
ocil_clause: the "rpcsvcgssd" is loaded and not masked
ocil: 'To check that the <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service is disabled in system boot
    configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>rpcsvcgssd</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service has either not been
    installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>rpcsvcgssd</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> is not active (i.e.
    not running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active rpcsvcgssd</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> is
    masked, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'

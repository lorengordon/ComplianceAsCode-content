description: 'Limit the MACs to strong hash algorithms.

    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> demonstrates use

    of those MACs:

    <pre>MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160</pre>'
rationale: 'MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown
    to increase

    exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great
    deal of

    attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power.
    An

    attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to
    decrypt the

    SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information'

ocil_clause: MACs option is commented out or not using strong hash algorithms
ocil: 'Only strong MACs should be used. To verify that only strong

    MACs are in use, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -i macs /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

    The output should contain only those MACs which are strong, namely,

    hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160

description: 'Deactivating wireless network interfaces should prevent normal usage
    of the wireless

    capability.

    <br /><br />


    Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo nmcli radio all off</pre>'
rationale: 'The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors
    into

    the organization''s network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association

    and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point

    (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the

    attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also

    serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of

    service to valid network resources.'

        srg_requirement: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 wireless network adapters must
            be disabled.
        vuldiscussion: This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies
            (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with Red Hat Enterprise
            Linux 7 systems. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards,
            Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present
            a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer.
            Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission
            and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Even though
            some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily
            carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications
            with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the Red Hat
            Enterprise Linux 7 operating system.

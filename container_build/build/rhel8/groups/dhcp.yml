description: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows\nsystems to request\
    \ and obtain an IP address and other configuration\nparameters from a server.\n\
    <br /><br />\nThis guide recommends configuring networking on clients by manually\
    \ editing\nthe appropriate files under <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>.  Use of DHCP can\
    \ make client \nsystems vulnerable to compromise by rogue DHCP servers, and should\
    \ be avoided \nunless necessary.  If using DHCP is necessary, however, there are\
    \ best practices \nthat should be followed to minimize security risk."

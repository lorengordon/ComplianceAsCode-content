description: 'If the system must act as a DHCP server, the configuration

    information it serves should be minimized. Also, support for other protocols

    and DNS-updating schemes should be explicitly disabled unless needed. The

    configuration file for dhcpd is called <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt>. The file

    begins with a number of global configuration options. The remainder of the file

    is divided into sections, one for each block of addresses offered by dhcpd,

    each of which contains configuration options specific to that address

    block.'

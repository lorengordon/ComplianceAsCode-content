description: 'When a user must temporarily leave an account

    logged-in, screen locking should be employed to prevent passersby

    from abusing the account. User education and training is

    particularly important for screen locking to be effective, and policies

    can be implemented to reinforce this.

    <br /><br />

    Automatic screen locking is only meant as a safeguard for

    those cases where a user forgot to lock the screen.'

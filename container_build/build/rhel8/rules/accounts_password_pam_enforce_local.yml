description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>local_users_only</tt> parameter controls
    requirements for

    enforcing password complexity by pam_pwquality only for local user accounts and
    ignoring

    centralized user account management password complexity configurations. Enable
    the <tt>local_users_only</tt>

    setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require password complexity
    enforcement

    for only local user accounts.'
rationale: 'The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting
    account management

    functions. Enterprise environments make application account management challenging
    and

    complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a
    potential

    oversight or other error.'

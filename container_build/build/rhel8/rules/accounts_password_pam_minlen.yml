description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>minlen</tt> parameter controls requirements
    for

    minimum characters required in a password. Add <tt>minlen=<sub idref="var_password_pam_minlen"
    /></tt>

    after pam_pwquality to set minimum password length requirements.'
rationale: 'The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations

    that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    <br />

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a

    password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength

    and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password

    helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to

    compromise the password.'

            Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce
            password complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf"
            file.


            The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of
            complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By
            setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those
            components be required, they will not count towards the total "score"
            of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.


            The DoD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.'

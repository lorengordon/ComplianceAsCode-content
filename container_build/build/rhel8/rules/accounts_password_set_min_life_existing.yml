description: 'Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 24 hours/1 day minimum
    password

    lifetime by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chage -m 1 <i>USER</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password

    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If

    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the

    password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the

    organization''s policy regarding password reuse.'

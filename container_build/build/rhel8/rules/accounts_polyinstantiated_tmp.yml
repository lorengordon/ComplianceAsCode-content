description: 'To configure polyinstantiated /tmp directories, first create the parent
    directories

    which will hold the polyinstantiation child directories. Use the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo mkdir --mode 000 /tmp/tmp-inst</pre>

    Then, add the following entry to <tt>/etc/security/namespace.conf</tt>:

    <pre>/tmp     /tmp/tmp-inst/            level      root,adm</pre>'
rationale: 'Polyinstantiation of temporary directories is a proactive security measure

    which reduces chances of attacks that are made possible by /tmp

    directories being world-writable.'

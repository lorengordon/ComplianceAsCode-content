description: 'Ensure that all interactive user initialization files executable search

    path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working

    directory other than the users home directory.'
rationale: 'The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains
    a

    list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path

    includes the current working directory (other than the users home directory),

    executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands.

    This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there
    is

    an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons,

    this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the

    default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they

    must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).'

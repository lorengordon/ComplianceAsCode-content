description: The operating system file integrity tool must be configured to protect
    the integrity of the audit tools.
rationale: 'Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a

    critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit

    information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,

    and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system

    activity.


    Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source

    audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information

    system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report

    generators.


    It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code

    into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system

    activity from the audit logs.


    To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to

    provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,

    manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or

    files.'

description: 'Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are
    set.

    Changing login UIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities
    which

    are not available to unprivileged users.

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the

    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to make login UIDs

    immutable:

    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to make login UIDs

    immutable:

    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>'
rationale: 'If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by
    unprivileged users and

    make auditing complicated or impossible.'

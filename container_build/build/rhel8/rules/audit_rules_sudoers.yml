description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect administrator actions

    for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default),

    add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory

    <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k actions</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k actions</pre>'
rationale: 'The actions taken by system administrators should be audited to keep a
    record

    of what was executed on the system, as well as, for accountability purposes.

    Editing the sudoers file may be sign of an attacker trying to

    establish persistent methods to a system, auditing the editing of the sudoers

    files mitigates this risk.'

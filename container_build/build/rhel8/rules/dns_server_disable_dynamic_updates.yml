description: "Is there a mission-critical reason to enable the risky dynamic\nupdate\
    \ functionality? If not, edit <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>. For each zone\nspecification,\
    \ correct the following directive if necessary:\n<pre>zone \"example.com \" IN\
    \ {\n  allow-update { none; };\n  ...\n};</pre>"
rationale: 'Dynamic updates allow remote servers to add, delete, or modify any

    entries in your zone file. Therefore, they should be considered highly risky,

    and disabled unless there is a very good reason for their use. If dynamic

    updates must be allowed, IP-based ACLs are insufficient protection, since they

    are easily spoofed. Instead, use TSIG keys (see the previous section for an

    example), and consider using the update-policy directive to restrict changes to

    only the precise type of change needed.'

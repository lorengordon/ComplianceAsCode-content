    the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a

    trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this

    requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an

            Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system

            the organization.

            The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This

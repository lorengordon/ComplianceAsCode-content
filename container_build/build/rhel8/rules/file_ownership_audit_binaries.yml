description: 'The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 operating system audit tools must have
    the proper

    ownership configured to protected against unauthorized access.


    Verify it by running the following command:

    <pre>$ stat -c "%n %U" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace
    /sbin/auditd /sbin/audispd /sbin/augenrules


    /sbin/auditctl root

    /sbin/aureport root

    /sbin/ausearch root

    /sbin/autrace root

    /sbin/auditd root

    /sbin/audispd root

    /sbin/augenrules root

    </pre>


    Audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information

    system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report

    generators'
rationale: 'Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting
    the

    tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit

    tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.


    Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information

    will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the

    tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys to make access decisions

    regarding the access to audit tools.'

    If the command does not return all the above lines, the missing ones

    need to be added.


    Run the following command to correct the permissions of the missing

    entries:

    <pre>$ sudo chown root [audit_tool] </pre>


    Replace "[audit_tool]" with each audit tool not owned by root.'

description: 'Is there a mission-critical reason for users to upload files via FTP?
    If not,

    edit the vsftpd configuration file to add or correct the following configuration
    options:

    <pre>write_enable=NO</pre>

    If FTP uploads are necessary, follow the guidance in the remainder of this section
    to secure these transactions

    as much as possible.'
rationale: 'Anonymous FTP can be a convenient way to make files available for universal
    download. However, it is less

    common to have a need to allow unauthenticated users to place files on the FTP
    server. If this must be done, it

    is necessary to ensure that files cannot be uploaded and downloaded from the same
    directory.'

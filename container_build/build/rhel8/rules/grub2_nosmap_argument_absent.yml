description: 'The SMAP is used to prevent the supervisor mode from unintentionally
    reading/writing into

    memory pages in the user space, it is enabled by default since Linux kernel 3.7.

    But it could be disabled through kernel boot parameters.


    Ensure that Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) is not disabled by

    the <tt>nosmap</tt> boot paramenter option.


    Check that the line <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="..."</pre> within <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>

    doesn''t contain the argument <tt>nosmap</tt>.

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:

    <pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="nosmap"</pre>'
rationale: 'Disabling SMAP can facilitate exploitation of vulnerabilities caused by
    unintended access and

    manipulation of data in the user space.'

ocil_clause: the kernel is configured to disable SMAP
ocil: 'Make sure that the kernel is not disabling SMAP with the following

    commands.

    <pre>grep -q nosmap /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>

    If the command returns a line, it means that SMAP is being disabled.'

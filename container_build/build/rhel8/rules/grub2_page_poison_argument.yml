description: 'To enable poisoning of free pages,

    add the argument <tt>page_poison=1</tt> to the default

    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    To ensure that <tt>page_poison=1</tt> is added as a kernel command line

    argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>page_poison=1</tt> to the

    default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:

    <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... page_poison=1 ..."</pre>

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre>#
    grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="page_poison=1"</pre>'
rationale: 'Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification
    or

    reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be

    detected and prevented.

    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance
    cost.

    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.'

ocil: 'Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system

    in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. If it includes <tt>page_poison=1</tt>,

    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.

    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*page_poison=1.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*page_poison=1.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>.Moreover,
    command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.

    Run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v ''page_poison=1''</pre>

    The command should not return any output.'

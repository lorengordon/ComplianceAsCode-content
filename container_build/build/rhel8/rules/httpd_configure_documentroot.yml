description: 'Every <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> that is configured should have an

    <tt>index.html</tt> file that exists. Add an <tt>index.html</tt> file to every

    configured <tt>DocumentRoot</tt>.'
rationale: 'The goal is to completely control the web users experience in navigating
    any

    portion of the web document root directories. Ensuring all web content

    directories have at least the equivalent of an index.html file is a significant

    factor to accomplish this end. Also, enumeration techniques, such as URL

    parameter manipulation, rely upon being able to obtain information about the web

    server''s directory structure by locating directories with default pages. This

    practice helps ensure that the anonymous web user will not obtain directory

    browsing information or an error message that reveals the server type and

    version.'

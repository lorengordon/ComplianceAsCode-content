description: 'Ensure that the SSH server service is enabled.


    The <code>sshd</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable sshd.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Logging into a web server remotely using an unencrypted protocol or service

    when performing updates and maintenance is a major risk. Data, such as user

    account, is transmitted in plaintext and can easily be compromised. When

    performing remote administrative tasks, a protocol or service that encrypts the

    communication channel must be used.

    <br /><br />

    An alternative to remote administration of

    the web server is to perform web server administration locally at the console.

    Local administration at the console implies physical access to the server.'

    Run the following command to determine the current status of the

    <code>sshd</code> service:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active sshd</pre>

    If the service is running, it should return the following: <pre>active</pre>'

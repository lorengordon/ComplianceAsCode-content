description: Users must not be allowed to access the shell programs.
rationale: 'Shell programs might execute shell escapes and could then perform

    unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web

    server. A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the

    user and the operating system. In this regard, there are shells that are

    security risks in the context of a web server and shells that are

    unauthorized.'

description: 'Normally, a service account is established for the web server. This
    is

    because a privileged account is not desirable and the server is designed to

    run for long uninterrupted periods of time. The SA or Web Manager will need

    password access to the web server to restart the service in the event or an

    emergency as the web server is not to restart automatically after an

    unscheduled interruption.'
rationale: 'If the password is not entrusted to an SA or web manager the ability to

    ensure the availability of the web server is compromised.'

ocil: 'The reviewed should make a note of the name of the account being used for

    the web service. This information may be needed later in the SRR. There

    may also be other server services running related to the web server in

    support of a particular web application, these passwords must be entrusted

    to the SA or Web Manager as well.


    Query the SA or Web Manager to determine if they have the web service

    password(s).


    NOTE: For installations that run as a service, or without a password,

    the SA or Web Manager having an Admin account on the system would meet

    the intent of this check.'

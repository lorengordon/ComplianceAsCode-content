description: 'Private web servers, which host sites that serve controlled access data,

    must be protected from outside threats in addition to insider threats.


    Isolate the private web server from the public DMZ and separate it from the

    internal general population LAN.'
rationale: 'Insider threat may be accidental or intentional but, in either case, can

    cause a disruption in service of the web server. To protect the private

    web server from these threats, it must be located on a separate controlled

    access subnet and must not be part of the public DMZ that houses the public

    web servers. it also cannot be located inside the enclave as part of the

    local general population LAN.'

ocil_clause: the private web server is not on a separate controlled access subnet
ocil: 'Verify the site''s network diagram and visually check the web server, to

    ensure that the private web server is located on a separate controlled

    access subnet and is not part of the public DMZ that houses the public

    web servers.


    In addition, the private web server needs to be isolated via a controlled

    access mechanism from the local general population lan.'

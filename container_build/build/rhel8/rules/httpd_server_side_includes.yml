description: 'Server Side Includes provide a method of dynamically generating web
    pages through the

    insertion of server-side code. However, the technology is also deprecated and

    introduces significant security concerns.

    If this functionality is unnecessary, comment out the related module:

    <pre>#LoadModule include_module modules/mod_include.so</pre>

    If there is a critical need for Server Side Includes, they should be enabled with
    the

    option <tt>IncludesNoExec</tt> to prevent arbitrary code execution. Additionally,
    user

    supplied data should be encoded to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.'
rationale: 'Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
    reduces risk

    by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.'

description: "Enabling this option prevents the kernel from accessing user-space memory\
    \ directly by pointing\nTTBR0_EL1 to a reserved zeroed area and reserved ASID.\n\
    The user access routines restore the valid TTBR0_EL1 temporarily.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 4.10, but may be available if backported\nby distros.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'The Privileged Access Never (PAN) is the ARM equivalent of the x86 Supervisor
    Mode Access

    Prevention (SMAP), and it prevents privileged acccess to user data unless explicitly
    enabled.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

description: "Enable this to turn on some debug checking for credential management.\
    \ The additional code keeps\ntrack of the number of pointers from task_structs\
    \ to any given cred struct, and checks to see\nthat this number never exceeds\
    \ the usage count of the cred struct.\n\nFurthermore, if SELinux is enabled, this\
    \ also checks that the security pointer in the cred\nstruct is never seen to be\
    \ invalid.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at\
    \ <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_CREDENTIALS</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_DEBUG_CREDENTIALS /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This adds sanity checks and validations to credential data structures.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

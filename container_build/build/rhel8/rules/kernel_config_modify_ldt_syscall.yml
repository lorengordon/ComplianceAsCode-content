description: "Linux can allow user programs to install a per-process x86 Local Descriptor\
    \ Table (LDT) using\nthe modify_ldt(2) system call. This is required to run 16-bit\
    \ or segmented code such as DOSEMU\nor some Wine programs. It is also used by\
    \ some very old threading libraries.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 4.3, but may be available if backported\nby distros.\n\nDisable LDT if 16-bit\
    \ program emulation is not necessary.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build\
    \ kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration\
    \ value for <tt>CONFIG_MODIFY_LDT_SYSCALL</tt>, run the following command:\n \
    \   <tt>grep CONFIG_MODIFY_LDT_SYSCALL /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs\
    \ with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either commented lines\
    \ or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: Disabling support for unnecessary code reduces attack surface.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

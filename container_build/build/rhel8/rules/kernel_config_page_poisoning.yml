description: "Fill the pages with poison patterns after free_pages() and verify the\
    \ patterns before\nalloc_pages. This does have a potential performance impact\
    \ if enabled with the \"page_poison=1\"\nkernel boot option.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 4.6.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep\
    \ CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each kernel installed,\
    \ a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: The filling of the memory helps reduce the risk of information leaks from
    freed data.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

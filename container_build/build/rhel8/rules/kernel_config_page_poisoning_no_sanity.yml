description: "Skip the sanity checking on alloc, only fill the pages with poison on\
    \ free. This reduces some\nof the overhead of the poisoning feature.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 4.6.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY</tt>, run the following command:\n \
    \   <tt>grep CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_NO_SANITY /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For\
    \ each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: This configuration helps alleviates the performance impact of poisonining.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

description: "Provides a virtual ELF core file of the live kernel.\n\nThe configuration\
    \ that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n   \
    \ To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_PROC_KCORE</tt>, run the following\
    \ command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_PROC_KCORE /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs\
    \ with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either commented lines\

rationale: 'This feature exposes the memory to the userspace and can assist an attacker
    in discovering

    attack vectors.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

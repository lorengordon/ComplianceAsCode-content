description: "In support of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), this\
    \ randomizes the physical\naddress at which the kernel image is decompressed and\
    \ the virtual address where the kernel\nimage is mapped.\n\nThe configuration\
    \ that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n   \
    \ To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE</tt>, run the\
    \ following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'An unpredictable kernel address makes it more difficult to succeed with
    exploits that rely on

    knowledge of the location of kernel code internals.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

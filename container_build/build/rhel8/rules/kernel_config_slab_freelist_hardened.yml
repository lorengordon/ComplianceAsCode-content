description: "This feature protects integrity of the allocator's metadata.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 4.14.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED</tt>, run the following command:\n   \
    \ <tt>grep CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each\
    \ kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'Many kernel heap attacks try to target slab cache metadata and other infrastructure.

    This options makes minor performance sacrifices to harden the kernel slab allocator
    against

    common freelist exploit methods.'

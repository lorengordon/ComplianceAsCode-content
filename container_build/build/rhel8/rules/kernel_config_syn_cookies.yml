description: "Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as SYN flooding.\n\
    It is denial-of-service attack that prevents legitimate remote users from being\
    \ able to connect\nto your computer during an ongoing attack.\n\nWhen enabled\
    \ the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge protocol known as SYN cookies\n\
    to enable legitimate users to continue to connect, even when your machine is under\
    \ attack.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES</tt>, run the\
    \ following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES /boot/config-*</tt>\n  \
    \  \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: SYN cookies provide protection against SYN flooding attacks.

warnings:
-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

    If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the <code>can</code> kernel
    module,

    it will contain lines inside any file in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> or the deprecated<code>
    /etc/modprobe.conf</code>.

    These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as
    <code>/bin/true</code>) upon a module <code>install</code> event.


    These lines can also instruct the module loading system to ignore the <code>can</code>
    kernel module via <code>blacklist</code> keyword.


    Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code>
    and the deprecated <code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code>:

    <pre>$ grep -r can /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d</pre>'

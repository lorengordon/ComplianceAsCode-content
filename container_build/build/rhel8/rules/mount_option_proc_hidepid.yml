description: "The <tt>hidepid</tt> mount option is applicable to <tt>/proc</tt> and\
    \ is used to\ncontrol who can access the information in <tt>/proc/[pid]</tt> directories.\n\
    The option can have one of the following values:\n<pre>\n0: Everybody may access\
    \ all /proc/[pid] directories.\n1: Users may not access files and subdirectories\
    \ inside any /proc/[pid] directories\n   but their own. The /proc/[pid] directories\
    \ themselves remain visible.\n2: Same as for mode 1, but in addition the /proc/[pid]\
    \ directories belonging to other\n   users become invisible.\n</pre>\nFor example,\
    \ if you choose the value 2:\nAdd the <code>hidepid=2</code> option to the fourth\
    \ column of\n<tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of\n<code>/proc</code>."
rationale: 'Users should not be able to see and access directories within /proc, which
    are not

    related to their own processes in a system. Otherwise, sensitive information from

    other users could be seem.'

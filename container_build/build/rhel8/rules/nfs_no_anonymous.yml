description: 'To specify the UID and GID for remote root users, edit the <tt>/etc/exports</tt>
    file and add the following for each export:

    <pre>

    anonuid=<tt>value greater than UID_MAX from /etc/login.defs</tt>

    anongid=<tt>value greater than GID_MAX from /etc/login.defs</tt>

    </pre>

    Note that a value of "-1" is technically acceptable as this will randomize the
    <tt>anonuid</tt> and

    <tt>anongid</tt> values on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux based NFS server. While
    acceptable from a security perspective,

    a value of <tt>-1</tt>  may cause interoperability issues, particularly with Red
    Hat Enterprise Linux 7 client systems.

    Alternatively, functionally equivalent values of 60001, 65534, 65535 may be used.'
rationale: 'Specifying the anonymous UID and GID ensures that the remote root user
    is mapped

    to a local account which has no permissions on the system.'

ocil_clause: anonuid or anongid are not set to a value greater than UID_MAX (for anonuid)
    and GID_MAX (for anongid)
ocil: 'Inspect the mounts configured in <tt>/etc/exports</tt>. Each mount should specify
    a value

    greater than UID_MAX and GID_MAX as defined in /etc/login.defs.'

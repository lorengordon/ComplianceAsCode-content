description: 'The <tt>freeradius</tt> package should be removed if not in use.

    Is this system a RADIUS server? If not, remove the package.

    The <code>freeradius</code> package can be removed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum erase freeradius</pre>

    The freeradius RPM is not installed by default on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

    system. It is needed only by the RADIUS servers, not by the

    clients which use RADIUS for authentication. If the system is not

    intended for use as a RADIUS Server it should be removed.'
rationale: 'Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack

    surface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on a

    RADIUS server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.'

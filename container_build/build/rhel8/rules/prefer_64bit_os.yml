description: Prefer installation of 64-bit operating systems when the CPU supports
    it.
rationale: 'Use of a 64-bit operating system offers a few advantages, like a larger
    address space range for

    Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and systematic presence of No eXecute
    and Execute Disable (NX/XD) protection bits.'

ocil_clause: the installed operating sytem is 32-bit but the CPU supports operation
    in 64-bit
ocil: 'To check if the installed Operating System is 64-bit, run the following command:

    <pre>$ uname -m</pre>

    The output should be one of the following: <tt>x86_64</tt>, <tt>aarch64</tt>,
    <tt>ppc64le</tt> or <tt>s390x</tt>.

    If the output is <tt>i686</tt> or <tt>i386</tt> the operating system is 32-bit.

    Check if the installed CPU supports 64-bit operating systems by running the following
    command:

    <pre>$ lscpu | grep "CPU op-mode"</pre>

    If the output contains <tt>64bit</tt>, the CPU supports 64-bit operating systems.'

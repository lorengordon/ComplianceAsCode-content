description: "Journald supports the ability to receive messages from remote hosts,\n\
    thus acting as a log server. Clients should not receive data from\nother hosts.\n\
    NOTE:\n    The same package, systemd-journal-remote , is used for both sending\n\
    \    logs to remote hosts and receiving incoming logs.\n    With regards to receiving\
    \ logs, there are two Systemd unit files;\n    systemd-journal-remote.socket and\
    \ systemd-journal-remote.service."
rationale: 'If a client is configured to also receive data, thus turning it into

    a server, the client system is acting outside it''s operational boundary.'

ocil_clause: the systemd-journal-remote socket is not masked
ocil: '

    To check that the <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code> socket is disabled
    in system boot configuration with systemd, run the following command:

    <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code> socket has
    either not been installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code><br/>disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code>
    is not active (i.e. not running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active systemd-journal-remote.socket</pre>


    If the socket is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The socket will also be masked, to check that the <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code>
    is masked, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>systemd-journal-remote.socket</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the socket is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'

warnings:
-   general: This rule should be understood primarily as a convenience administration
        feature. This rule ensures that if the USBGuard default rules.conf file is
        present, it will alter it so that USB human interface devices are allowed.
        However, if the rules.conf file is altered by system administrator, the rule
        does not check if USB human interface devices are allowed. This assumes that
        an administrator modified the file with some purpose in mind.

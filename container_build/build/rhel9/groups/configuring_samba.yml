description: 'All settings for the Samba daemon can be found in

    <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>. Settings are divided between a

    <tt>[global]</tt> configuration section and a series of user

    created share definition sections meant to describe file or print

    shares on the system. By default, Samba will operate in user mode

    and allow client systems to access local home directories and

    printers. It is recommended that these settings be changed or that

    additional limitations be set in place.'

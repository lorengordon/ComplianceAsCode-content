description: 'FTP is a common method for allowing remote access to

    files. Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means

    that passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be

    captured and that the session is vulnerable to hijacking.

    Therefore, running the FTP server software is not recommended.

    <br /><br />

    However, there are some FTP server configurations which may

    be appropriate for some environments, particularly those which

    allow only read-only anonymous access as a means of downloading

    data available to the public.'

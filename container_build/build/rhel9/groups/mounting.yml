description: 'Linux includes a number of facilities for the automated addition

    and removal of filesystems on a running system.  These facilities may be

    necessary in many environments, but this capability also carries some risk --
    whether direct

    risk from allowing users to introduce arbitrary filesystems,

    or risk that software flaws in the automated mount facility itself could

    allow an attacker to compromise the system.

    <br /><br />

    This command can be used to list the types of filesystems that are

    available to the currently executing kernel:

    <pre>$ find /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs -type f -name ''*.ko''</pre>

    If these filesystems are not required then they can be explicitly disabled

    in a configuratio file in  <tt>/etc/modprobe.d</tt>.'

description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>dictcheck</tt> check if passwords contains
    dictionary words. When

    <tt>dictcheck</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt> passwords will be checked for dictionary
    words.'
rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password
    in resisting attempts at

    guessing and brute-force attacks.

    <br /><br />

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more

    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need
    to be tested before the

    password is compromised.

    <br /><br />

    Passwords with dictionary words may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.'

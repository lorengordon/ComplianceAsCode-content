description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>difok</tt> parameter sets the number
    of characters

    in a password that must not be present in and old password during a password change.

    <br /><br />

    Modify the <tt>difok</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt>

    to equal <sub idref="var_password_pam_difok" /> to require differing characters

    when changing passwords.'
rationale: "Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources\nrequired\
    \ to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,\nis a measure\
    \ of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts\nat guessing and brute\u2013\
    force attacks.\n<br /><br />\nPassword complexity is one factor of several that\
    \ determines how long\nit takes to crack a password. The more complex the password,\
    \ the\ngreater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested\nbefore\
    \ the password is compromised.\n<br /><br />\nRequiring a minimum number of different\
    \ characters during password changes ensures that\nnewly changed passwords should\
    \ not resemble previously compromised ones.\nNote that passwords which are changed\
    \ on compromised systems will still be compromised, however."

description: 'This rule ensures that the system lock out accounts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>
    persist

    after system reboot. From "pam_faillock" man pages:

    <pre>Note that the default directory that "pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared
    on system

    boot so the access will be reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable,
    a different

    tally directory must be set with the "dir" option.</pre>


    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must
    be carefully

    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid errors when manually editing these
    files, it is

    recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,

    depending on the OS version.'
rationale: 'Locking out user accounts after a number of incorrect attempts prevents
    direct password

    guessing attacks. In combination with the <tt>silent</tt> option, user enumeration
    attacks

    are also mitigated.'

description: 'Ensure that successful attempts to access a file are audited.


    The following rules configure audit as described above:

    <pre>## Successful file access (any other opens) This has to go last.

    ## These next two are likely to result in a whole lot of events

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open,openat,openat2,open_by_handle_at -F success=1
    -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-access

    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat,openat2,open_by_handle_at -F success=1 -F
    auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-access    </pre>


    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:

    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>


    Note: This rule uses a special set of Audit rules to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You
    may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended
    that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned
    with your needs.'
rationale: Auditing of successful attempts to access a file helps in investigation
    of activities performed on the system.

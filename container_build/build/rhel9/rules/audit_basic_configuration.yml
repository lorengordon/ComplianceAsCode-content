description: 'Perform basic configuration of Audit system.

    Make sure that any previously defined rules are cleared, the auditing system is
    configured to handle sudden bursts of events, and in cases of failure, messages
    are configured to be directed to system log.


    The following rules configure audit as described above:

    <pre>## First rule - delete all

    -D


    ## Increase the buffers to survive stress events.

    ## Make this bigger for busy systems

    -b 8192


    ## This determine how long to wait in burst of events

    --backlog_wait_time 60000


    ## Set failure mode to syslog

    -f 1    </pre>


    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:

    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>'
rationale: Without basic configurations, audit may not perform as expected. It may
    not be able to correctly handle events under stressful conditions, or log events
    in case of failure.

-   performance: It might happen that Audit buffer configured by this rule is not
        large enough for certain use cases. If that is the case, the buffer size can
        be overridden by placing <pre>-b larger_buffer_size</pre> into a file within
        <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> directory, replacing <tt>larger_file_size</tt>
        with the desired value. The file name should start with a number higher than
        10 and lower than 99.

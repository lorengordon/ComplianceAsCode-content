description: 'To configure the system cryptography policy to use ciphers only from
    the <tt><sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></tt>

    policy, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo update-crypto-policies --set <sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy"
    /></pre>

    The rule checks if settings for selected crypto policy are configured as expected.
    Configuration files in the <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends</tt> are either
    symlinks to correct files provided by Crypto-policies package or they are regular
    files in case crypto policy customizations are applied.

    Crypto policies may be customized by crypto policy modules, in which case it is
    delimited from the base policy using a colon.'
rationale: 'Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across
    an operating system and

    the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested encryption
    algorithms

    undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data.'

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

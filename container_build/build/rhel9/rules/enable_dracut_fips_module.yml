-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based
        security

        systems to protect sensitive information in computer and telecommunication
        systems

        (including voice systems) as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology

        Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be
        used in designing

        and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal departments and agencies
        operate or are

        operated for them under contract.

        See <b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by a
        vendor that has

        undergone this certification. This means providing documentation, test results,
        design

        information, and independent third party review by an accredited lab. While
        open source

        software is capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the
        vendor submits to

        this process.'

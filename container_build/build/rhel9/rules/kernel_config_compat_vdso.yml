description: "Certain buggy versions of glibc (2.3.3) will crash if they are presented\
    \ with a 32-bit vDSO\nthat is not mapped at the address indicated in its segment\
    \ table.\nSetting <tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO</tt> to <tt>y</tt> turns off the 32-bit\
    \ VDSO and works\naroud the glibc bug.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build\
    \ kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration\
    \ value for <tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep\
    \ CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs with value 'n' are\
    \ not explicitly set in the file, so either commented lines or no\n    lines should\
    \ be returned.\n    "
rationale: Enabling VDSO compatibility hurts performance and disables ASLR.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

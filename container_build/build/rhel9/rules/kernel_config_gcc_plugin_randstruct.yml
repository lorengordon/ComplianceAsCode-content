description: "Randomize at compile-time the layouts of structures that are entirely\
    \ function pointers\n(and have not been manually annotated with __no_randomize_layout),\
    \ or structures that have\nbeen explicitly marked with __randomize_layout.\nThis\
    \ configuration is available from kernel 4.13, but may be available if backported\n\
    by distros.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at\
    \ <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'Randomizing the layout of kernel data structures make it more difficult
    for an attacker to

    know the location of sensitive data.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

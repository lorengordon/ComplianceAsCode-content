description: "While the kernel is built with warnings enabled for any missed stack\
    \ variable initializations,\nthis warning is silenced for anything passed by reference\
    \ to another function, under the\noccasionally misguided assumption that the function\
    \ will do the initialization. As this\nregularly leads to exploitable flaws, this\
    \ plugin is available to identify and zero-initialize\nsuch variables, depending\
    \ on the chosen level of coverage.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 4.11, but may be available if backported\nby distros.\n\nThe configuration that\
    \ was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check\
    \ the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK</tt>, run the following\
    \ command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK /boot/config-*</tt>\n  \
    \  \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: Initializing structures from userspace can prevent some classes of information
    exposure.

description: "Disable the Linux traditional BSD-like terminal names /dev/ptyxx for\
    \ masters and /dev/ttyxx for\nslaves of pseudo terminals, and use only the modern\
    \ ptys (devpts) interface.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS\
    \ /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set\
    \ in the file, so either commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: The legacy scheme has a number of security problems.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

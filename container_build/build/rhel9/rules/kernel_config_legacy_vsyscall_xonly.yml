description: "The kernel traps and emulates calls into the fixed vsyscall address\
    \ mapping and does not allow\nreads.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 5.3.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_XONLY</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_XONLY /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: Disabling this mitigates certain uses of the vsyscall area as an ASLR-bypassing
    buffer.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

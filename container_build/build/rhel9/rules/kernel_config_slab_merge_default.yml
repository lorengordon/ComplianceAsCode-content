description: "For reduced kernel memory fragmentation, slab caches can be merged when\
    \ they share the same\nsize and other characteristics. This carries a risk of\
    \ kernel heap overflows being able to\noverwrite objects from merged caches (and\
    \ more easily control cache layout), which makes such\nheap attacks easier to\
    \ exploit by attackers.\nThis configuration is available from kernel 4.13.\n\n\
    The configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'Disabling the merge of slabs of similar sizes prevents the kernel from

    merging a seemingly useless but vulnerable slab with a useful and valuable slab.

    This increase the risk that a heap overflow could overwrite objects from merged
    caches,

    with unmerged caches the heap overflow would only affect the objects in the same
    cache.

    Overall, this reduces the kernel attack surface area by isolating slabs from each
    other.'

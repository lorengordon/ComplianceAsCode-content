description: 'The <tt>grpquota</tt> mount option allows for the filesystem to have
    disk quotas configured.

    Add the <code>grpquota</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/home</code>.'
rationale: 'To ensure the availability of disk space on /home, it is important to
    limit the impact a

    single user or group can cause for other users (or the wider system) by intentionally
    or

    accidentally filling up the partition. Quotas can also be applied to inodes for
    filesystems

    where inode exhaustion is a concern.'

warnings:
-   general: 'The quota options for XFS file systems can only be activated when mounting
        the partition.

        It is not possible to enable them by remounting an already mounted partition.
        Therefore,

        if the desired options were not defined before mounting the partition, dismount
        and mount

        it again to apply the quota options.'

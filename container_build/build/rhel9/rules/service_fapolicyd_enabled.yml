        vuldiscussion: 'The organization must identify authorized software programs
            and permit execution of authorized software. The process used to identify
            software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information
            systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.


            Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing
            the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software
            decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification
            of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system startup.


            User home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature.
            Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with
            an SA through shared resources.


            Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 ships with many optional packages. One such
            package is a file access policy daemon called "fapolicyd". "fapolicyd"
            is a userspace daemon that determines access rights to files based on
            attributes of the process and file. It can be used to either blacklist
            or whitelist processes or file access.


            Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper configuration
            may render the system non-functional. The "fapolicyd" API is not namespace
            aware and can cause issues when launching or running containers.'

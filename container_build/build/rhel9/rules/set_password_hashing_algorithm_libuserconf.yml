description: 'In <tt>/etc/libuser.conf</tt>, add or correct the following line in
    its

    <tt>[defaults]</tt> section to ensure the system will use the SHA-512

    algorithm for password hashing:

    <pre>crypt_style = sha512</pre>'
rationale: 'Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard

    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can

    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that

    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are

    kepy in plain text.

    <br /><br />

    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are

    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.

    Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use

    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more

    difficult.'

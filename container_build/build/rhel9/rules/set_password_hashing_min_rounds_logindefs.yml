description: 'In <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>, ensure <tt>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS</tt> and

    <tt>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</tt> has the minimum value of <tt>5000</tt>.

    For example:

    <pre>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000

    SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000</pre>

    Notice that if neither are set, they already have the default value of 5000.

    If either is set, they must have the minimum value of 5000.'
rationale: 'Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard

    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can

    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords

    that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if

    they are kept in plain text.

    <br /><br />

    Using more hashing rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.'

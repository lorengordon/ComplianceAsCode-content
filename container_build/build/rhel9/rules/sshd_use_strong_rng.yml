description: 'To set up SSH server to use entropy from a high-quality source, edit
    the <tt>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</tt> file.

    The <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> configuration value determines how many bytes
    of entropy to use, so

    make sure that the file contains line

    <pre>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>'
rationale: 'SSH implementation in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 uses the openssl library,
    which doesn''t use

    high-entropy sources by default. Randomness is needed to generate data-encryption
    keys, and as

    plaintext padding and initialization vectors in encryption algorithms, and high-quality

    entropy elliminates the possibility that the output of the random number generator
    used by SSH

    would be known to potential attackers.'

    then the option is set correctly.'

srg_requirement: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 must ensure the SSH server uses strong

warnings:
-   general: This setting can cause problems on computers without the hardware random
        generator, because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked
        until enough entropy is available.

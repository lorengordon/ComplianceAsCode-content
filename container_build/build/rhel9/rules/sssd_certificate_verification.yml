        vuldiscussion: 'Using an authentication device, such as a DoD Common Access
            Card (CAC) or token that is separate from the information system, ensures
            that even if the information system is compromised, credentials stored
            on the authentication device will not be affected.


            Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems
            gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based
            or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S.
            Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card and the DoD CAC.


            Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 includes multiple options for configuring certificate
            status checking, but for this requirement focuses on the System Security
            Services Daemon (SSSD). By default, sssd performs Online Certificate Status
            Protocol (OCSP) checking and certificate verification using a sha256 digest
            function.'

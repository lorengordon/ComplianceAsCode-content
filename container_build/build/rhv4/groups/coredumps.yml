description: 'A core dump file is the memory image of an executable

    program when it was terminated by the operating system due to

    errant behavior. In most cases, only software developers

    legitimately need to access these files. The core dump files may

    also contain sensitive information, or unnecessarily occupy large

    amounts of disk space.

    <br /><br />

    Once a hard limit is set in <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>, or

    to a file within the <tt>/etc/security/limits.d/</tt> directory, a

    user cannot increase that limit within his or her own session. If access

    to core dumps is required, consider restricting them to only

    certain users or groups. See the <tt>limits.conf</tt> man page for more

    information.

    <br /><br />

    The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The

    <tt>sysctl</tt> variable <tt>fs.suid_dumpable</tt> controls whether

    the kernel allows core dumps from these programs at all. The default

    value of 0 is recommended.'

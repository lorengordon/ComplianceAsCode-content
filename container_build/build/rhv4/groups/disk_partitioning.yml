description: "To ensure separation and protection of data, there\nare top-level system\
    \ directories which should be placed on their\nown physical partition or logical\
    \ volume. The installer's default\npartitioning scheme creates separate logical\
    \ volumes for\n<tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and <tt>swap</tt>.\n<ul>\n<li>If starting\
    \ with any of the default layouts, check the box to\n\\\"Review and modify partitioning.\\\
    \" This allows for the easy creation\nof additional logical volumes inside the\
    \ volume group already\ncreated, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical\
    \ volume smaller to\ncreate space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable\
    \ to\nusing partitions because they can be more easily adjusted\nlater.</li>\n\
    <li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in\nthe previous\
    \ paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),\nas well as separate ones\
    \ described in the following sections.</li>\n</ul>\nIf a system has already been\
    \ installed, and the default\npartitioning\nscheme was used, it is possible but\
    \ nontrivial to\nmodify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories\n\
    listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.\nSee the LVM\
    \ HOWTO at \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/'>http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/</a>\n\

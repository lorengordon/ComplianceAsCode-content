    \ for <tt>httpd</tt>.\nFollowing its installation with the base ruleset, specific\
    \ configuration advice can be found at\n\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\
    \ href='http://www.modsecurity.org/'>http://www.modsecurity.org/</a> to design\
    \ a policy that best matches the security needs of\nthe web applications. Usage\
    \ of <tt>mod_security</tt> is highly recommended for some environments,\nbut it\
    \ should be noted this module does not ship with Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself,\n\
    and instead is provided via Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL).\nFor more\

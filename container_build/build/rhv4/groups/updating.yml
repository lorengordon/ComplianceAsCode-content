description: 'The <tt>yum</tt> command line tool is used to install and

    update software packages. The system also provides a graphical

    software update tool in the <b>System</b> menu, in the <b>Administration</b> submenu,

    called <b>Software Update</b>.

    <br /><br />

    Red Hat Virtualization 4 systems contain an installed software catalog called

    the RPM database, which records metadata of installed packages. Consistently using

    <tt>yum</tt> or the graphical <b>Software Update</b> for all software installation

    allows for insight into the current inventory of installed software on the system.

description: '

    Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured

    in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. This provides redundant name resolution services

    in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain

    as least <tt>2</tt> DNS servers, add a corresponding <tt>nameserver

    <i>ip_address</i></tt> entry in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> for each DNS

    server where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of a valid DNS server.

    For example:

    <pre>search example.com

    nameserver 192.168.0.1

    nameserver 192.168.0.2</pre>'
rationale: 'To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant

    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the

    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include

    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.'

    By default, "NetworkManager" on Red Hat Virtualization 4 dynamically updates the

    profiles. However, this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations.


    If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or
    add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative
    name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf"
    file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows:

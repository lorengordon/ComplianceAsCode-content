description: 'The <code>policycoreutils</code> package can be installed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

rationale: 'Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number
    of utilities

    with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls
    to Linux.

    The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally

    developed to improve security of the Flask operating system. These architectural
    components

    provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
    control

    policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based
    Access

    Control, and Multi-level Security.


    <tt>policycoreutils</tt> contains the policy core utilities that are required
    for

    basic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include <tt>load_policy</tt>

    to load SELinux policies, <tt>setfiles</tt> to label filesystems, <tt>newrole</tt>
    to

    switch roles, and so on.'

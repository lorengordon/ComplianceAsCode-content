description: 'To enable console screen locking, install the <tt>tmux</tt> package.

    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away
    from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want
    to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.

    Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session
    can be locked, Red Hat Virtualization 4 needs to provide users with the ability
    to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary
    to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following command:

    <pre>$ tmux</pre>

    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:

    <pre>ctrl+b :lock-session</pre>'
rationale: 'A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops
    work and moves away from the immediate

    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the
    temporary nature of the absence.

    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operation system session
    prior to vacating the vicinity,

    operating systems need to be able to identify when a user''s session has idled
    and take action to initiate the

    session lock.

    <br /><br />

    The <tt>tmux</tt> package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.'

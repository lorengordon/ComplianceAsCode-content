description: 'Using Kerberos on all exported mounts prevents a malicious client or
    user from

    impersonating a system user. To cryptography authenticate users to the NFS server,

    add <tt>sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p</tt> to each export in <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.'
rationale: 'When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS a selected userid and
    groupid are used to handle

    requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously
    be set

    incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server
    and client

    systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.'

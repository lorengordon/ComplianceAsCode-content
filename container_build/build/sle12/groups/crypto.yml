description: 'Linux has the capability to centrally configure cryptographic polices.
    The command

    <tt>update-crypto-policies</tt> is used to set the policy applicable for the various

    cryptographic back-ends, such as SSL/TLS libraries. The configured cryptographic

    policies will be the default policy used by these backends unless the application

    user configures them otherwise. When the system has been configured to use the

    centralized cryptographic policies, the administrator is assured that any application

    that utilizes the supported backends will follow a policy that adheres to the

    configured profile.


    Currently the supported backends are:

    <ul>

    <li>GnuTLS library</li>

    <li>OpenSSL library</li>

    <li>NSS library</li>

    <li>OpenJDK</li>

    <li>Libkrb5</li>

    <li>BIND</li>

    <li>OpenSSH</li>

    </ul>

    Applications and languages which rely on any of these backends will follow the

    system policies as well. Examples are apache httpd, nginx, php, and others.'

description: "A default installation of <tt>httpd</tt> includes a plethora of dynamically\
    \ shared objects (DSO)\nthat are loaded at run-time. Unlike the aforementioned\
    \ compiled-in modules, a DSO can be\ndisabled in the configuration file by removing\
    \ the corresponding LoadModule directive.\n<br /><br />\nNote: A DSO only provides\
    \ additional functionality if associated directives are included\nin the <tt>httpd</tt>\
    \ configuration file. It should also be noted that removing a DSO will produce\n\
    errors on <tt>httpd</tt> startup if the configuration file contains directives\
    \ that apply to that\nmodule. Refer to <tt>\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\
    \ href='http://httpd.apache.org/docs/'>http://httpd.apache.org/docs/</a></tt>\
    \ for details on which directives\nare associated with each DSO.\n<br /><br />\n\
    Following each DSO removal, the configuration can be tested with the following\
    \ command\nto check if everything still works:\n<pre>$ sudo service httpd configtest</pre>\n\
    The purpose of each of the modules loaded by default will now be addressed one\
    \ at a time.\nIf none of a module's directives are being used, remove it."

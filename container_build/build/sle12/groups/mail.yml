description: "Mail servers are used to send and receive email over the network.\n\
    Mail is a very common service, and Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are obvious\ntargets\
    \ of network attack.\nEnsure that systems are not running MTAs unnecessarily,\n\
    and configure needed MTAs as defensively as possible.\n<br /><br />\nVery few\
    \ systems at any site should be configured to directly receive email over the\n\
    network. Users should instead use mail client programs to retrieve email\nfrom\
    \ a central server that supports protocols such as IMAP or POP3.\nHowever, it\
    \ is normal for most systems to be independently capable of sending email,\nfor\
    \ instance so that cron jobs can report output to an administrator.\nMost MTAs,\
    \ including Postfix, support a submission-only mode in which mail can be sent\
    \ from\nthe local system to a central site MTA (or directly delivered to a local\
    \ account),\nbut the system still cannot receive mail directly over a network.\n\
    <br /><br />\nThe <tt>alternatives</tt> program in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 permits\
    \ selection of other mail server software\n(such as Sendmail), but Postfix is\
    \ the default and is preferred.\nPostfix was coded with security in mind and can\
    \ also be more effectively contained by\nSELinux as its modular design has resulted\
    \ in separate processes performing specific actions.\nMore information is available\
    \ on its website, \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='http://www.postfix.org'>http://www.postfix.org</a>."

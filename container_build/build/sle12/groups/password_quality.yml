description: 'The default <tt>pam_pwquality</tt> PAM module provides strength

    checking for passwords. It performs a number of checks, such as

    making sure passwords are not similar to dictionary words, are of

    at least a certain length, are not the previous password reversed,

    and are not simply a change of case from the previous password. It

    can also require passwords to be in certain character classes. The

    <tt>pam_pwquality</tt> module is the preferred way of configuring

    password requirements.

    <br /><br />

    The man pages <tt>pam_pwquality(8)</tt>

    provide information on the capabilities and configuration of

    each.'

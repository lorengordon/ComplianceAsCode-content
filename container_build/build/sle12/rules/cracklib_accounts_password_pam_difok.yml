description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>difok</tt> parameter controls requirements
    for

    usage of different characters during a password change. The number of

    changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to

    the total number of positions in the current password. In other words,

    characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions

    of the like characters must be different.

    Make sure the <tt>difok</tt> parameter for the pam_cracklib module is

    configured to greater than or equal to <tt><sub idref="var_password_pam_difok"
    /></tt>.'
rationale: 'Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes

    ensures that newly changed passwords should not resemble previously

    compromised ones. Note that passwords which are changed on compromised

    systems will still be compromised, however.'

    following command:

    <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

    password requisite pam_cracklib.so difok=<sub idref="var_password_pam_difok" /></pre>

    The <tt>difok</tt> parameter will indicate how many characters must differ.

    The DoD requires at least eight characters differ during a password change.

    This would appear as <tt>difok=8</tt>.'

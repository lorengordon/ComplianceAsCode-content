description: 'In the default graphical environment, displaying a login warning banner

    in the GNOME Display Manager''s login screen can be enabled on the login

    screen by setting <tt>banner-message-enable</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

    <br /><br />

    To enable, add or edit <tt>banner-message-enable</tt> to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

    banner-message-enable=true</pre>

    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.

    For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-enable</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

    The banner text must also be set.'
rationale: 'Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting
    access to the operating system

    ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable
    federal laws,

    Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

    <br /><br />

    For U.S. Government systems, system use notifications are required only for access
    via login interfaces

    with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.'

description: 'The <tt>shosts.equiv</tt> file list remote hosts

    and users that are trusted by the local system.

    To remove these files, run the following command to delete them from any

    location:

    <pre>$ sudo rm /[path]/[to]/[file]/shosts.equiv</pre>'
rationale: 'The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication
    for the

    system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing

    unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive

    identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of

    two-factor authentication.'

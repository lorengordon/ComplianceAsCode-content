description: 'It is recommended that the <tt>/boot</tt> directory resides on a separate

    partition. This makes it easier to apply restrictions e.g. through the

    <tt>noexec</tt> mount option. Eventually, the <tt>/boot</tt> partition can

    be configured not to be mounted automatically with the <tt>noauto</tt> mount

    option.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/boot</tt> partition contains the kernel and bootloader files.

    Access to this partition should be restricted.'

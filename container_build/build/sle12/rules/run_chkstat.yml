description: 'Verify that the SUSE operating system prevents unauthorized users from

    accessing system command and library files.


    Check that all of the audit information files and folders have the correct

    permissions with the following command:

    <pre># sudo chkstat --warn --system</pre>


    Set the correct permissions with the following command:


    <pre># sudo chkstat --set --system</pre>'
rationale: 'If the SUSE operating system were to allow any user to make changes to

    software libraries, those changes might be implemented without undergoing

    the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change

    management process.


    This requirement applies to SUSE operating systems with software libraries

    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted

    languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute

    with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must

    be allowed to obtain access to information system components to initiate

    changes, including upgrades and modifications.'

description: 'The sudo command allows a user to execute programs with elevated

    (administrator) privileges. It prompts the user for their password

    and confirms your request to execute a command by checking a file,

    called sudoers.

    Restrict privileged actions by removing the following entries from the sudoers
    file:

    <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL</tt>

    <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</tt>'
rationale: 'If the "sudoers" file is not configured correctly, any user defined

    on the system can initiate privileged actions on the target system.'

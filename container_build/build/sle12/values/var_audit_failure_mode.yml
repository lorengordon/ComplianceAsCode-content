description: 'This variable is the setting for the -f option in Audit configuration
    which sets the failure mode of audit.

    This option lets you determine how you want the kernel to handle critical errors.

    Possible values are: 0=silent, 1=printk, 2=panic.

    If the value is set to "2", the system is configured to panic (shut down) in the
    event of an auditing failure.

    If the value is set to "1", the system is configured to only send information
    to the kernel log regarding the failure.'

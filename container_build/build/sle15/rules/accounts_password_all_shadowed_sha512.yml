description: 'Verify the operating system requires the shadow password suite

    configuration be set to encrypt interactive user passwords using a strong

    cryptographic hash.

    Check that the interactive user account passwords are using a strong

    password hash with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo cut -d: -f2 /etc/shadow

    $6$kcOnRq/5$NUEYPuyL.wghQwWssXRcLRFiiru7f5JPV6GaJhNC2aK5F3PZpE/BCCtwrxRc/AInKMNX3CdMw11m9STiql12f/</pre>

    Password hashes <tt>!</tt> or <tt>*</tt> indicate inactive accounts not

    available for logon and are not evaluated.

    If any interactive user password hash does not begin with <tt>$6</tt>,

    this is a finding.'
rationale: 'Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for

    protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read

    (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.'

description: 'AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.

    To set all profiles to enforce mode run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*</pre>

    To list unconfined processes run the following command:


    <pre>$ sudo aa-unconfined</pre>


    Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated

    for them and then be restarted.'
rationale: 'Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites
    may

    mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly

    acceptable. This recommendation is intended to ensure that any policies that

    exist on the system are activated.'

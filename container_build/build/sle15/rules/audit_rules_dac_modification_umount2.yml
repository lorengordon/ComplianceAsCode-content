description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect file system umount2

    changes. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured

    to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon

    startup (the default), add the following line to a file with suffix

    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount2 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset -F
    key=perm_mod</pre>

    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S umount2 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset -F
    key=perm_mod</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount2 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset -F
    key=perm_mod</pre>

    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S umount2 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset -F
    key=perm_mod</pre>'
rationale: 'The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting
    to

    gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications

    can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and

    unauthorized users.'

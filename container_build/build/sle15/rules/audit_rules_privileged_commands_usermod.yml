description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of

    privileged commands for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is

    configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during

    daemon startup (the default), add a line of the following form to a file with

    suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/usermod -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add a line of the following

    form to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/usermod -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>'
rationale: 'Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally
    by

    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system
    accounts,

    is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.

    Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and
    identify

    the risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.

    <br /><br />

    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,

    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but

    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for

    unusual activity.'

        vuldiscussion: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the
            security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult
            to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident
            or identify those responsible for one.


            Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
            system (e.g., module or policy filter).


            When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is
            being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid
            set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which
            equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset"
            in the same way.


            The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts
            each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very
            important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these
            affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The
            performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule
            whenever possible.'

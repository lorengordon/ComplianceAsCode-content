description: 'Files containing sensitive informations should be protected by restrictive

    permissions. Most of the time, there is no need that these files need to be read
    by any non-root user


    To properly set the permissions of <code>/var/log/messages</code>, run the command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod 0640 /var/log/messages</pre>


    Check that "permissions.local" file contains the correct permissions rules with
    the following command:


    <pre># grep -i messages /etc/permissions.local


    /var/log/messages root:root 640</pre>'
rationale: 'The <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> file contains system error messages. Only

    authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the

    errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization''s operational

    state or can identify the SUSE operating system or platform. Additionally,

    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information must

    not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their

    designated representatives.'

ocil: 'To check the permissions of <code>/var/log/messages</code>,

    run the command:

    <pre>$ ls -l /var/log/messages</pre>

    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:

    <code>-rw-r-----</code>

    with the following command:

    If the command does not return any or different output, this is a finding.


    Run the following command to correct the permissions after adding the missing
    entry:


    <pre># sudo chkstat --set --system</pre>'

description: 'Systems that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package

    do not need to install the kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit

    x86 kernel already includes this support. However, if the system is

    32-bit and also supports the PAE and NX features as

    determined in the previous section, the kernel-PAE package should

    be installed to enable XD or NX support.

    The <code>kernel-PAE</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo zypper install kernel-PAE</pre>

    The installation process should also have configured the

    bootloader to load the new kernel at boot. Verify this after reboot

    and modify <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> if necessary.'
rationale: 'On 32-bit systems that support the XD or NX bit, the vendor-supplied

    PAE kernel is required to enable either Execute Disable (XD) or No Execute (NX)
    support.'

description: 'The <code>firewalld</code> package can be installed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo zypper install firewalld</pre>'
rationale: '"Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit remote access
    to the system via ports, services, and protocols.


    Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices
    and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk
    and make remote user access management difficult at best.


    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized
    user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled
    network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.


    SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement
    action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.

    Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing
    compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote
    access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers,
    workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."'

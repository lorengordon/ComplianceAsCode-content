description: 'The INFO parameter specifices that record login and logout activity
    will be logged.

    <br/>

    The default SSH configuration sets the log level to INFO. The appropriate

    configuration is used if no value is set for <tt>LogLevel</tt>.

    <br/>

    To explicitly specify the log level in SSH, add or correct the following line
    in



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>LogLevel INFO</pre>'
rationale: 'SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
    <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically

    not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it
    provides

    so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
    <tt>INFO</tt> level is the

    basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations,
    such as Incident

    Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a
    system. The

    logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the
    field.'

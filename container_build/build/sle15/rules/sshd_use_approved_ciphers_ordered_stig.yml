description: 'Limit the ciphers to those algorithms which are FIPS-approved.

    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>

    demonstrates use of FIPS-approved ciphers:

    <pre>Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr</pre>

    This rule ensures that there are configured ciphers mentioned

    above (or their subset), keeping the given order of algorithms.'
rationale: 'Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic
    module are not verified and therefore

    cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data
    may be compromised.

    <br />

    Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms
    for authenticating to

    cryptographic modules.

    <br />

    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access
    cryptographic modules

    utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government
    systems, this allows

    Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15.'

-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

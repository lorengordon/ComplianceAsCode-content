description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid</code>
    kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2</pre>

    To make sure that the setting is persistent, add the following line to a file
    in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>: <pre>kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 2</pre>'
rationale: Kernel profiling can reveal sensitive information about kernel behaviour.

        vuldiscussion: 'Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the
            risk of information, including encrypted representations of information,
            produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes
            acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current
            users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system
            resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources
            have been released back to information systems. The control of information
            in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual
            information protection.


            This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology
            product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information
            system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified
            by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.


            There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files
            in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

description: "Services and ports can be accepted or explicitly rejected or dropped\
    \ by a zone.\nFor every zone, a default behavior can be set that handles incoming\
    \ traffic that \nis not further specified. Such behavior is defined by setting\
    \ the target of the zone. \nThe possible options are:\n- <tt>ACCEPT</tt> - accepts\
    \ all incoming packets except those disabled by a specific rule.\n- <tt>REJECT</tt>\
    \ - disables all incoming packets except those that have been allowed in\n   specific\
    \ rules and the source machine is informed about the rejection.\n- <tt>DROP</tt>\
    \ - disables all incoming packets except those that have been allowed in\n   specific\
    \ rules and no information sent to the source machine."
rationale: 'To reduce the attack surface of a system, all services and ports should
    be blocked unless

    required.'

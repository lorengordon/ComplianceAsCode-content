are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
      Is it the case that partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS?
      </pre></td>
	<td><pre>Oracle Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.

For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.


For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE
Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher
with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.


Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 8 Documentation web site:

	<td>SRG-OS-ID</td>
	<td><pre>Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It
is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor;
it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the
subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted
root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for
certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is
necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any
certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes
certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.

	<td><pre>Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates
the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access
to information or privileges.

Privileged functions include, for example,
establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering
cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals
who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection
and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples
of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.</pre></td>

privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering
implemented security safeguards/countermeasures, run the following
command:
$ sudo semanage login -l
All administrators must be mapped to the sysadm_u or staff_u
users with the appropriate domains (sysadm_t and staff_t).

All authorized non-administrative

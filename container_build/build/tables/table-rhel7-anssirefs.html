        When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.

following command:

        Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized
users to delete files in the directory structure.

The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file
repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the

for directories requiring global read/write access.

        Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates
the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access

Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing
system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management
activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate
authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or
malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that

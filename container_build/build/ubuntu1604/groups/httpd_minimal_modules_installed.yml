description: 'The default <tt>httpd</tt> installation minimizes the number of

    modules that are compiled directly into the binary (<tt>core prefork http_core

    mod_so</tt>). This minimizes risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the

    web server.


    Query the set of compiled-in modules using the following command:

    <pre>$ httpd -l</pre>

    If the number of compiled-in modules is significantly larger than the

    aforementioned set, this guide recommends re-installing <tt>httpd</tt> with a

    reduced configuration. Minimizing the number of modules that are compiled into

    the <tt>httpd</tt> binary, reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by

    the webserver.'

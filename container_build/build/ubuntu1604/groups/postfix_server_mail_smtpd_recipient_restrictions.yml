    <br />\nThe full contents of <tt>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</tt> will\nvary\
    \ by site, since this is a common place to put spam restrictions and other\nsite-specific\
    \ options. The <tt>permit_mynetworks</tt> option allows all mail to\nbe relayed\
    \ from the systems in <tt>mynetworks</tt>. Then, the\n<tt>reject_unauth_destination</tt>\
    \ option denies all mail whose destination\naddress is not local, preventing any\
    \ other systems from relaying. These two\noptions should always appear in this\
    \ order, and should usually follow one\nanother immediately unless SMTP AUTH is\
    \ used."

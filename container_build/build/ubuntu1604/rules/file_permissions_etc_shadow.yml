    To properly set the permissions of <code>/etc/shadow</code>, run the command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod 0640 /etc/shadow</pre>'
rationale: 'The <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> file contains the list of local

    system accounts and stores password hashes. Protection of this file is

    critical for system security. Failure to give ownership of this file

    to root provides the designated owner with access to sensitive information

    which could weaken the system security posture.'

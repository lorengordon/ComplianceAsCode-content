description: 'When a user logs into a Unix account, the system

    configures the user''s session by reading a number of files. Many of

    these files are located in the user''s home directory, and may have

    weak permissions as a result of user error or misconfiguration. If

    an attacker can modify or even read certain types of account

    configuration information, they can often gain full access to the

    affected user''s account. Therefore, it is important to test and

    correct configuration file permissions for interactive accounts,

    particularly those of privileged users such as root or system

    administrators.'

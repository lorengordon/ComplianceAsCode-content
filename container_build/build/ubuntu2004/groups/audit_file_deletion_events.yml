description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect file deletion events

    for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the

    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>, setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as

    appropriate for your system:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S rmdir,unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F auid&gt;=1000
    -F auid!=unset -F key=delete</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file, setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as

    appropriate for your system:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S rmdir,unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F auid&gt;=1000
    -F auid!=unset -F key=delete</pre>'

description: 'At a minimum, AIDE should be configured to run a weekly scan.

    To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following
    line to <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>:

    <pre>05 4 * * * root /usr/bin/aide.wrapper --config {{{ aide_conf_path }}} --check</pre>

    To implement a weekly execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following
    line to <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>:

    <pre>05 4 * * 0 root /usr/bin/aide.wrapper --config {{{ aide_conf_path }}} --check</pre>

    AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.

    The usage of cron''s special time codes, such as  <tt>@daily</tt> and

    <tt>@weekly</tt> is acceptable.'
rationale: 'By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. Periodically

    running AIDE is necessary to reveal unexpected changes in installed files.

    <br /><br />

    Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable

    to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes
    to

    operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which
    may

    be relevant to security.

    <br /><br />

    Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,

    negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating

    system. The operating system''s Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information
    System

    Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email
    and/or

    monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration
    item.'

            Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification
            of results of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is
            installed on the system, use the following commands:


            $ ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide


            -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide

description: 'Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security

    functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured,

    disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques;

    and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may

    include isolation of memory space and libraries.


    The Ubuntu operating system restricts access to security functions

    through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least

    privilege capabilities.'
rationale: 'Any users assigned to the sudo group would be granted administrator

    access to the system.'

description: 'Ubuntu 20.04 systems support an "recovery boot" option that can be used

    to prevent services from being started. The <tt>GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY</tt>

    configuration option in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> should be set to

    <tt>true</tt> to disable the generation of recovery mode menu entries. It is

    also required to change the runtime configuration, run:

    <pre>$ sudo update-grub </pre>'
rationale: 'Using recovery boot, the console user could disable auditing, firewalls,

    or other services, weakening system security.'

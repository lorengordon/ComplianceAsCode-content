description: 'Configure the operating system to implement multifactor authentication
    by

    installing the required package with the following command:


    The <code>libpam-pkcs11</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ apt-get install libpam-pkcs11</pre>'
rationale: 'Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
    from

    the information system, ensures that even if the information system is

    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the

    authentication device.

    <br /><br />

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from

    information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens

    providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such

    as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common

    Access Card.'

            access to

            privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication

            requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

            authorizations of a privileged user.

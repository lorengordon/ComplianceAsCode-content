description: 'On a system where FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, <tt>/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</tt>
    must exist.

    To verify FIPS mode, run the following command:

    <pre>cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</pre>'
rationale: 'Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes
    of utilizing encryption to

    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering
    to the higher

    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they
    have been tested

    and validated.'

-   general: "To configure the OS to run in FIPS 140-2 mode, the kernel parameter\

-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

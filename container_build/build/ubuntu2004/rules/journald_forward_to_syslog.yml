description: 'Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally.

    Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs.'
rationale: Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks.
    If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or
    remove log data that is stored on the local system.

ocil: 'Storing logs remotely protects the integrity of the data from local attacks.

    Run the following command to verify that journald is forwarding logs to a remote
    host.

    <pre>

    grep "^\sForwardToSyslog" /etc/systemd/journald.conf

    and it should return

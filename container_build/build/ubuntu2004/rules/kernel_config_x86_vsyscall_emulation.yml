description: "Disabling it is roughly equivalent to booting with vsyscall=none, except\
    \ that it will also\ndisable the helpful warning if a program tries to use a vsyscall.\
    \ With this option set to N,\noffending programs will just segfault, citing addresses\
    \ of the form 0xffffffffff600?00.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 3.19.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: The vsyscall table is no longer required and is a potential source of ROP
    gadgets.

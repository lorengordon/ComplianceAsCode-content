description: 'The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries

    from being executed out of <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.

    Add the <code>noexec</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/var/tmp</code>.'
rationale: 'Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories

    such as <tt>/var/tmp</tt> should never be necessary in normal operation and

    can expose the system to potential compromise.'

        vuldiscussion: The "noexec" mount option causes the system to not execute
            binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not
            containing approved binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing
            files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged
            users to attain unauthorized administrative access.

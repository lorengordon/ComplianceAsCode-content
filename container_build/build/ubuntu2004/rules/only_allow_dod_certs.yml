description: 'The operating system must only allow the use of DoD PKI-established

    certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of

    protected sessions.'
rationale: 'Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they

    may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise

    DoD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If

    the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA,

    trust of this CA has not been established.

    The DoD will only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a DoD-approved

    internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the

    establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of

    SSL/TLS certificates.'

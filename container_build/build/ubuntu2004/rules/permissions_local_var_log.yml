description: 'Any operating system providing too much information in error messages

    risks compromising the data and security of the structure, and content

    of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization.


    Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.

    The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle

    error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational

    requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes,

    for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake

    as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from

    (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal

    information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit

    card numbers.'
rationale: 'The Ubuntu 20.04 must generate error messages that provide information

    necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could

    be exploited by adversaries.'

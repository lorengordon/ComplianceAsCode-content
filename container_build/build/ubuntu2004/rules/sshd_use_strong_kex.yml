description: 'Limit the Key Exchange to strong algorithms.

    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> demonstrates use

    of those:

    <pre>KexAlgorithms <sub idref="sshd_strong_kex" /></pre>'
rationale: 'Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys
    are exchanged

    between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender
    and receiver

    wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages
    to be

    sent and decrypt messages received'

ocil: 'Only strong KEX algorithms should be used. To verify that only strong

    KexAlgorithms are in use, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -i kexalgorithms /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

    The output should contain only those KexAlgorithms which are strong, namely,

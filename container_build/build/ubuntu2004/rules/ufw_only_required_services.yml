    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify

    the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.'
rationale: 'To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of

    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types

    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or

    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.


    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions

    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default

    may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.

    Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services

    from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so

    increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.


    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the

    operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing

    only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,

    and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to

    conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life

    issues.'

    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify

    the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.


    Add all ports, protocols, or services allowed by the PPSM CLSA by using

    the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo ufw allow "direction" "port/protocol/service"</pre>

    where the direction is "in" or "out" and the port is the one

    corresponding to the protocol or service allowed.


    To deny access to ports, protocols, or services, use:

    <pre>$ sudo ufw deny "direction" "port/protocol/service"</pre>'

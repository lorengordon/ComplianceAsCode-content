description: 'The audit system already collects login information for all users

    and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the

    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual

    edits of files involved in storing logon events:

    <pre>-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

    -w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for unattempted manual

    edits of files involved in storing logon events:

description: 'CUPS provides the ability to easily share local printers with

    other systems over the network. It does this by allowing systems to share

    lists of available printers. Additionally, each system that runs the CUPS

    service can potentially act as a print server. Whenever possible, the printer

    sharing and print server capabilities of CUPS should be limited or disabled.

    The following recommendations should demonstrate how to do just that.'

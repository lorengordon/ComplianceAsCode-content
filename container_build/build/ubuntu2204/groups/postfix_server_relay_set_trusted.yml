description: 'Edit <tt>/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt>, and configure the contents of

    the <tt>mynetworks</tt> variable in one of the following ways:

    <ul>

    <li>If any system in the subnet containing the MTA may be trusted to relay

    messages, add or correct the following line:

    <pre>mynetworks_style = subnet</pre>

    This is also the default setting, and is in effect if all

    <tt>my_networks_style</tt> directives are commented.</li>

    <li>If only the MTA host itself is trusted to relay messages, add or correct

    the following line:

    <pre>mynetworks_style = host</pre></li>

    <li>If the set of systems which can relay is more complicated, manually

    specify an entry for each netblock or IP address which is trusted to relay by

    setting the <tt>mynetworks</tt> variable directly:

    <pre>mynetworks = 10.0.0.0/16, 192.168.1.0/24, 127.0.0.1</pre></li>

    </ul>'

description: 'Create home directories to all interactive users that currently do not

    have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user

    home directory assigned in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>:

rationale: 'If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not
    exist,

    the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory

    upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be

    able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility

    to system files they normally would not be able to access.'

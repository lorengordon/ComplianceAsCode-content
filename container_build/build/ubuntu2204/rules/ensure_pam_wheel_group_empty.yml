description: 'Ensure that the group <sub idref="var_pam_wheel_group_for_su" />

    referenced by the pam_wheel  <tt>group</tt> parameter exists and has no

    members. This ensures that no user can run commands with altered

    privileges through the <tt>su</tt> command.'
rationale: 'The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute user
    and

    group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root user. Limiting

    access to such command is considered a good security practice.'

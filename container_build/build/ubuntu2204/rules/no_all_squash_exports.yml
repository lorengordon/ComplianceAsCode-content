description: 'The <tt>all_squash</tt> maps all uids and gids to an anonymous user.

    This should be disabled by removing any instances of the

    <tt>all_squash</tt> option from the file <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.'
rationale: 'The all_squash option maps all client requests to a single anonymous

    uid/gid on the NFS server, negating the ability to track file access

    by user ID.'

description: '

    By removing the <tt>gdm3</tt> package, the system no longer has GNOME installed


    installed. If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical
    user mode.

    This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a
    <tt>graphical.target</tt>

    mode. To do so, run the following command:


    <pre>$ sudo apt remove gdm3</pre>'
rationale: 'Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system.

    A graphical environment is unnecessary for certain types of systems including
    a virtualization

    hypervisor.'

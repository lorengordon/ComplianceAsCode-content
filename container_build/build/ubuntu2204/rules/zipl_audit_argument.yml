description: 'To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start prior
    to the audit daemon,

    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>audit=1</tt>

    included in its options.<br />


    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable audit,

    add <tt>audit=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.'
rationale: 'Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates
    whether

    its activities can be audited. Although <tt>auditd</tt> takes care of enabling

    this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument

    ensures it is set for every process during boot.'

    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn''t enable
    audit.'

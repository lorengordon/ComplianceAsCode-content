description: 'Conventionally, Unix shell accounts are accessed by

    providing a username and password to a login program, which tests

    these values for correctness using the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> files. Password-based login is vulnerable to

    guessing of weak passwords, and to sniffing and man-in-the-middle

    attacks against passwords entered over a network or at an insecure

    console. Therefore, mechanisms for accessing accounts by entering

    usernames and passwords should be restricted to those which are

    operationally necessary.'

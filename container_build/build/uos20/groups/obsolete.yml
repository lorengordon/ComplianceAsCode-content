description: 'This section discusses a number of network-visible

    services which have historically caused problems for system

    security, and for which disabling or severely limiting the service

    has been the best available guidance for some time. As a result of

    this, many of these services are not installed as part of UnionTech OS Server
    20

    by default.

    <br /><br />

    Organizations which are running these services should

    switch to more secure equivalents as soon as possible.

    If it remains absolutely necessary to run one of

    these services for legacy reasons, care should be taken to restrict

    the service as much as possible, for instance by configuring host


    firewall software such as <tt>iptables</tt> to restrict access to the


    vulnerable service to only those remote hosts which have a known

    need to use it.'

description: 'Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against a common wide industry
    wide performance

    optimization known as Speculative Store Bypass (SSB).


    In such cases, recent stores to the same memory location cannot always be observed
    by later

    loads during speculative execution. However, such stores are unlikely and thus
    they can be

    detected prior to instruction retirement at the end of a particular speculation
    execution

    window.


    Since Linux Kernel 4.17 you can check the SSB mitigation state with the following
    command:

    <tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass</tt>


    Select the appropriate SSB state by adding the argument

    <tt>spec_store_bypass_disable=<sub idref="var_spec_store_bypass_disable_options"
    /></tt> to the default

    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    Configure the default Grub2 kernel command line to contain spec_store_bypass_disable=<sub
    idref="var_spec_store_bypass_disable_options" /> as follows:

    <pre># grub2-editenv - set "$(grub2-editenv - list | grep kernelopts) spec_store_bypass_disable=<sub
    idref="var_spec_store_bypass_disable_options" />"</pre>'
rationale: 'In vulnerable processsors, the speculatively forwarded store can be used
    in a cache side channel

    attack. An example of this is reading memory to which the attacker does not directly
    have access,

    for example inside the sandboxed code.'

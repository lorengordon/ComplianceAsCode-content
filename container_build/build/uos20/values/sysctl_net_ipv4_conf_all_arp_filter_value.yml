description: "Controls whether the ARP filter is enabled or not.\n\n1 - Allows you\
    \ to have multiple network interfaces on the same subnet, and have the ARPs for\
    \ each\ninterface be answered based on whether or not the kernel would route a\
    \ packet from the ARP\u2019d IP out that interface.\nIn other words it allows\
    \ control of which cards (usually 1) will respond to an ARP request.\n\n0 - (default)\
    \ The kernel can respond to arp requests with addresses from other interfaces.\n\
    This may seem wrong but it usually makes sense, because it increases the chance\
    \ of successful communication.\nIP addresses are owned by the complete host on\
    \ Linux, not by particular interfaces."

description: "Plugins are developed internally or by third party sources and are designed\
    \ to extend\nGoogle Chromium's functionality. All plugins should be blacklisted\
    \ from \ninstallation by default. To blacklist all plugins set <tt>DisabledPlugins</tt>\n\
    to <tt>*</tt> in the Chromium policy file."
rationale: 'Plugins can access almost anything on a system and users can enable or
    install them

    at will. This means they pose a high risk to any system that would allow all plugins

    to be installed by default.'

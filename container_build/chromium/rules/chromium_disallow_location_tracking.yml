description: "Location tracking is enabled by default and can track user's browsing\
    \ habits.\nLocation tracking should be disabled by setting <tt>DefaultGeolocationSetting</tt>\
    \ \nto <tt>2</tt> in the Chromium policy file."
rationale: "Website tracking is the practice of gathering information as to which\
    \ websites\nwere accesses by a browser. The common method of doing this is to\
    \ have a website\ncreate a tracking cookie on the browser. If the information\
    \ of what sites are\nbeing accessed is made available to unauthorized persons,\
    \ this violates \nconfidentiality requirements, and over time poses a significant\
    \ OPSEC issue."

description: 'Network interfaces expand the attack surface of the

    system.  Unused interfaces are not monitored or controlled, and

    should be disabled.

    <br /><br />

    If the system does not require network communications but still

    needs to use the loopback interface, remove all files of the form

    <tt>ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt> except for <tt>ifcfg-lo</tt> from

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts</tt>:

    <pre>$ sudo rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></pre>

    If the system is a standalone machine with no need for network access or even

    communication over the loopback device, then disable this service.


    The <code>network</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now network.service</pre>'

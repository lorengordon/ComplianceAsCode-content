description: 'Compression is useful for slow network connections over long

    distances but can cause performance issues on local LANs. If use of compression

    is required, it should be enabled only after a user has authenticated; otherwise,

    it should be disabled. To disable compression or delay compression until after

    a user has successfully authenticated, add or correct the following line in the

    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

    <pre>Compression <sub idref="var_sshd_disable_compression" /></pre>'
rationale: 'If compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication,

    vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of the

    system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially with root privileges.'

description: 'Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic.

    Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback

    network.'
rationale: 'Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is

    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface

    is the only place that loopback network traffic should be seen,

    all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an

    anti-spoofing measure.'

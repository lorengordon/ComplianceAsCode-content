description: 'Recent processors in the x86 family support the

    ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis.

    Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No

    Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute

    Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer

    overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible.

    Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is

    enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such

    as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception

    and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the

    feature. This is enabled by default on the latest Oracle Linux, Red Hat and

    Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.'

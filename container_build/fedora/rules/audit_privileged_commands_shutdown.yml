description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of

    privileged commands for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is

    configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during

    daemon startup (the default), add a line of the following form to a file with

    suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/shutdown -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add a line of the following

    form to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/shutdown -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>'
rationale: Misuse of the shutdown command may cause availability issues for the system.

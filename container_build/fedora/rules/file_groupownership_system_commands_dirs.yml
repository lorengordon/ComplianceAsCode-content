description: 'System commands files are stored in the following directories by default:

    <pre>/bin

    /sbin

    /usr/bin

    /usr/sbin

    /usr/local/bin

    /usr/local/sbin

    </pre>

    All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> group,

    or a system account.

    If the directory, or any file in these directories, is found to be owned

    by a group other than root or a a system account correct its ownership

    with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>FILE</i></pre>'
rationale: 'If the operating system allows any user to make changes to software

    libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the

    appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management

    process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries

    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

    Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with

    escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be

    allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes

    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'

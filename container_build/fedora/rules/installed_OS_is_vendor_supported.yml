description: 'The installed operating system must be maintained by a vendor.


    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise

    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for providing security patches.'
rationale: 'An operating system is considered "supported" if the vendor continues
    to

    provide security patches for the product.  With an unsupported release, it

    will not be possible to resolve any security issue discovered in the system

    software.'

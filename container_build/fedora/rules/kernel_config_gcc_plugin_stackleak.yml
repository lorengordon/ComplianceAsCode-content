description: "This option makes the kernel erase the kernel stack before returning\
    \ from system calls.\nThis has the effect of leaving the stack initialized to\
    \ the poison value, which both reduces\nthe lifetime of any sensitive stack contents\
    \ and reduces potential for uninitialized stack\nvariable exploits or information\
    \ exposures (it does not cover functions reaching the same\nstack depth as prior\
    \ functions during the same syscall).\n\nThis configuration is available from\
    \ kernel 4.20, but may be available if backported\nby distros.\n\nThe configuration\
    \ that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n   \
    \ To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK</tt>, run\
    \ the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'This blocks most uninitialized stack variable attacks, with the performance
    impact being

    driven by the depth of the stack usage, rather than the function calling complexity.'

warnings:
-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.
-   performance: The performance impact on a single CPU system kernel is of 1% slowdown.

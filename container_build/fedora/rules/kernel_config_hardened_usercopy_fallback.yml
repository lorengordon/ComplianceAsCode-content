description: "This is a temporary option that allows missing usercopy whitelists to\
    \ be discovered via a WARN()\nto the kernel log, instead of rejecting the copy,\
    \ falling back to non-whitelisted hardened\nusercopy that checks the slab allocation\
    \ size instead of the whitelist size.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 4.16.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_FALLBACK</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_FALLBACK /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: This config prevents entire classes of heap overflow exploits and similar
    kernel memory exposures.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

description: "Enable this to use virtually-mapped kernel stacks with guard pages.\n\
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.9.\n\nThe configuration that was\
    \ used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check\
    \ the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_VMAP_STACK</tt>, run the following command:\n\
    \    <tt>grep CONFIG_VMAP_STACK /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each kernel\
    \ installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: This causes kernel stack overflows to be caught immediately rather than
    causing difficult-to-diagnose corruption.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

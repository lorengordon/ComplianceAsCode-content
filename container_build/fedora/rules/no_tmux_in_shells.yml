        vuldiscussion: 'The session lock is implemented at the point where session
            activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period
            of time to expire before the user session can be locked, Fedora needs
            to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so
            users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate
            the immediate physical vicinity.


            Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that enables a number of terminals to be
            created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  Red Hat endorses
            tmux as the recommended session controlling package.'

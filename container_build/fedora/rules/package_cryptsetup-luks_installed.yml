description: 'The <code>cryptsetup-luks</code> package can be installed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo dnf install cryptsetup-luks</pre>'
rationale: 'LUKS is the upcoming standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing
    a standard

    on-disk format, it does not only facilitate compatibility among distributions,
    but also

    provide secure management of multiple user passwords. In contrast to existing
    solution,

    LUKS stores all necessary setup information in the partition header, enabling
    the user

    to transport or migrate their data seamlessly. LUKS for dm-crypt is implemented
    in

    <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. <tt>cryptsetup-luks</tt> is intended as a complete replacement
    for the

    original <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. It provides all the functionality of the original

    version plus all LUKS features, that are accessible by luks* action.'

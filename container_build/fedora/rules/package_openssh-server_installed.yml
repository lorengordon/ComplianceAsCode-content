        vuldiscussion: 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality
            and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can
            be intercepted and either read or altered.


            This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all
            types of information system components from which information can be transmitted
            (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers,
            scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical
            protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
            interception and modification.


            Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information
            can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution
            systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques).
            If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography)
            do not have to be employed, and vice versa.'

rationale: '<tt>tuned</tt> contains a daemon that tunes the system settings dynamically.

    It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically.
    Based

    on that information, components will then be put into lower or higher power savings

    modes to adapt to the current usage.'

        vuldiscussion: 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install
            by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives.
            These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore
            may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing
            additional attack vectors.


            Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
            and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default,
            may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g.,
            key missions, functions).


            The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes the system settings dynamically.
            It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically.
            Based on that information, components will then be put into lower or higher
            power savings modes to adapt to the current usage. The tuned package is
            not needed for normal OS operations.'

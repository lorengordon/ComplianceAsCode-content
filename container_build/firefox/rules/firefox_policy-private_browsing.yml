description: 'Private browsing may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting

    the <tt>DisablePrivateBrowsing</tt> key under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.'
rationale: Private browsing allows the user to browse the internet without recording
    their browsing history/activity. From a forensics perspective, this is unacceptable.
    Best practice requires that browser history is retained.

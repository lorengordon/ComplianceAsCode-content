description: 'Telemetry can be disabled by setting

    <tt>toolkit.telemetry.enabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.'
rationale: The Telemetry feature provides this capability by sending performance and
    usage info to Mozilla. As you use Firefox, Telemetry measures and collects non-personal
    information, such as performance, hardware, usage and customizations. It then
    sends this information to Mozilla on a daily basis and we use it to improve Firefox

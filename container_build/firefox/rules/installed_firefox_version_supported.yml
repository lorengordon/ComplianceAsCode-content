description: 'If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite
    Server,

    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:

    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>

    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form
    of RPM packages)

    can be manually downloaded and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.'
rationale: 'Use of versions of an application which are not supported by the vendor

    are not permitted. Vendors respond to security flaws with updates and

    patches. These updates are not available for unsupported version which

    can leave the application vulnerable to attack.'

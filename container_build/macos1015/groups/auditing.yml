    auditing system. The audit() function submits a record to the kernel for inclusion
    in the

    global audit trail. The record must already be in BSM format. To protect

    the integrity of the audit trail, this system call must be made with sufficient

    privileges. Libbsm can be used to create and manipulate BSM data. Length

    is the length in bytes of the BSM record and record points to the data.

    The audit service provides substantial capabilities for recording system

    activities. Secure networks often have substantial auditing

    requirements, and <tt>auditd</tt> can be configured to meet these

    requirements.'

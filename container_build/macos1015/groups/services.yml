    This section describes how to review

    the software which Apple macOS 10.15 installs on a system and disable software
    which is not needed. It

    then enumerates the software packages installed on a default Apple macOS 10.15
    system and provides guidance about which

    ones can be safely disabled.

    <br /><br />

    Apple macOS 10.15 provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially
    installs the bare necessities for a functional

    system. When building Apple macOS 10.15 systems, it is highly recommended to select
    the minimal packages and then build up

    the system from there.'

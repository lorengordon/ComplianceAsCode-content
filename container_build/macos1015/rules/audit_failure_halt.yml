description: 'The macOS system must shut down by default upon audit

    failure unless availability is an overriding concern.'
rationale: "The audit service should shut down the computer if it \nis unable to audit\
    \ system events. Once audit failure\noccurs, user and system activity is no longer\
    \ recorded\nand malicious activity could go undetected. Audit\nprocessing failures\
    \ include software/hardware errors,\nfailures in the audit capturing mechanisms,\
    \ and audit\nstorage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses\nto audit failure\
    \ depend on the nature of the failure\nmode."

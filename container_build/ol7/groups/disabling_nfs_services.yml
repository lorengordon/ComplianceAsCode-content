description: 'If NFS is not needed, disable the NFS client daemons nfslock, rpcgssd,
    and rpcidmapd.

    <br /><br />

    All of these daemons run with elevated privileges, and many listen for network

    connections. If they are not needed, they should be disabled to improve system

    security posture.'

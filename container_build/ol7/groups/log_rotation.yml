description: "\nEdit the file <tt>/etc/logrotate.d/syslog</tt>. Find the first\n\n\
    line, which should look like this (wrapped for clarity):\n<pre>/var/log/messages\
    \ /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler \\\n  /var/log/boot.log /var/log/cron\
    \ {</pre>\nEdit this line so that it contains a one-space-separated\nlisting of\
    \ each log file referenced in <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>.\n<br /><br />\nAll logs\
    \ in use on a system must be rotated regularly, or the\nlog files will consume\
    \ disk space over time, eventually interfering\nwith system operation. The file\
    \ <tt>/etc/logrotate.d/syslog</tt> is the\nconfiguration file used by the <tt>logrotate</tt>\
    \ program to maintain all\nlog files written by <tt>syslog</tt>. By default, it\
    \ rotates logs weekly and\nstores four archival copies of each log. These settings\
    \ can be\nmodified by editing <tt>/etc/logrotate.conf</tt>, but the defaults are\n\
    sufficient for purposes of this guide.\n<br /><br />\nNote that <tt>logrotate</tt>\
    \ is run nightly by the cron job\n<tt>/etc/cron.daily/logrotate</tt>. If particularly\
    \ active logs need to be\nrotated more often than once a day, some other mechanism\
    \ must be\nused."

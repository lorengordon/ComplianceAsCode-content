description: "<tt>If firewalld or iptables are being used in your environment, please\
    \ follow the guidance in their\nrespective section and pass-over the guidance\
    \ in this section.</tt>\n<br /><br />\nnftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel\
    \ providing filtering and classification of network\npackets/datagrams/frames\
    \ and is the successor to iptables. The biggest change with the\nsuccessor nftables\
    \ is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and\n\
    use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. With nftables, the\
    \ simpler\nsyntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and\
    \ less repetition.\nSupport for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel,\
    \ together with the related\nnftables modules.\n<br /><br /> \nIt is available\
    \ in Linux kernels >= 3.13. <b>Please ensure that your kernel\nsupports nftables\
    \ before choosing this option.</b>"

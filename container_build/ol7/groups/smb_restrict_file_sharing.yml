description: "Only users with local user accounts will be able to log in to\nSamba\
    \ shares by default. Shares can be limited to particular users or network\naddresses.\
    \ Use the <tt>hosts allow</tt> and <tt>hosts deny</tt> directives\naccordingly,\
    \ and consider setting the valid users directive to a limited subset\nof users\
    \ or to a group of users. Separate each address, user, or user group\nwith a space\
    \ as follows for a particular <i>share</i> or global:\n<pre>[<i>share</i>]\n \
    \ hosts allow = 192.168.1. 127.0.0.1\n  valid users = userone usertwo @usergroup</pre>\n\
    It is also possible to limit read and write access to particular users with the\n\
    read list and write list options, though the permissions set by the system\nitself\
    \ will override these settings. Set the read only attribute for each share\nto\
    \ ensure that global settings will not accidentally override the individual\n\
    share settings. Then, as with the valid users directive, separate each user or\n\
    group of users with a space:\n<pre>[<i>share</i>]\n  read only = yes\n  write\
    \ list = userone usertwo @usergroup</pre>"

description: 'The pam_pwquality module''s <tt>ocredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements
    for

    usage of special (or "other") characters in a password. When set to a negative
    number,

    any password will be required to contain that many special characters.

    When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1

    additional length credit for each special character. Modify the <tt>ocredit</tt>
    setting

    in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <sub idref="var_password_pam_ocredit"
    />

    to require use of a special character in passwords.'
rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required

    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of

    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force

    attacks.

    <br /><br />

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes

    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of

    possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks

    more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.'

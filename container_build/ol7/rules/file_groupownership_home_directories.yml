description: 'Change the group owner of interactive users home directory to the

    group found in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. To change the group owner of

    interactive users home directory, use the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>


    This rule ensures every home directory related to an interactive user is

    group-owned by an interactive user. It also ensures that interactive users

    are group-owners of one and only one home directory.'
rationale: 'If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive users home directory
    is

    not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized

    access to the users files, and users that share the same group may not be

    able to access files that they legitimately should.'

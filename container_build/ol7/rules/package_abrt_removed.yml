description: 'The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (<tt>abrt</tt>) collects

    and reports crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety

    of plugins, abrt can email crash reports to system administrators, log crash

    reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking

    system such as RHTSupport.

    The <code>abrt</code> package can be removed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum erase abrt</pre>'
rationale: 'Mishandling crash data could expose sensitive information about

    vulnerabilities in software executing on the system, as well as sensitive

    information from within a process''s address space or registers.'

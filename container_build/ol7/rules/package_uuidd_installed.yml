description: 'The package <tt>uuidd</tt> is not installed on normal Linux distribution

    by default. Applications require this package to avoid database

    inconsistences caused by duplicated UUIDs. Especially in banking services

    with SAP where massive UUIDs are created in a short time period, it is

    important to install the package <tt>uuidd</tt>. More information can be

    found in SAP note 1391070.

    The <code>uuidd</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum install uuidd</pre>'
rationale: 'The <tt>uuidd</tt> package contains a userspace daemon (uuidd) which is

    used to generate unique identifiers even at very high rates on

    SMP systems.'

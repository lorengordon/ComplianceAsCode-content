description: 'The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.


    The <code>sshd</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable sshd.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality, and

    integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be

    intercepted and either read or altered.

    <br /><br />

    This checklist item applies to both internal and external networks and all types

    of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g.,
    servers,

    mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, etc). Communication
    paths

    outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility

    of interception and modification.'

        srg_requirement: All Oracle Linux 7 networked systems must have and implement
            SSH to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted and received
            information, as well as information during preparation for transmission.
        vuldiscussion: 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality
            and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can
            be intercepted and either read or altered.


            This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all
            types of information system components from which information can be transmitted
            (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers,
            scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical
            protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
            interception and modification.


            Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information
            can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution
            systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques).
            If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography)
            do not have to be employed, and vice versa.'

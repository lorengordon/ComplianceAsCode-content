    (column 3) is <tt>nfs</tt> or <tt>nfs4</tt>, add the text

    <tt>,nodev,nosuid</tt> to the list of mount options in column 4. If

    appropriate, also add <tt>,noexec</tt>.

    See the section titled "Restrict Partition Mount Options" for a description of

    the effects of these options. In general, execution of files mounted via NFS

    should be considered risky because of the possibility that an adversary could

    intercept the request and substitute a malicious file. Allowing setuid files to

    be executed from remote servers is particularly risky, both for this reason and

    because it requires the clients to extend root-level trust to the NFS

    server.'

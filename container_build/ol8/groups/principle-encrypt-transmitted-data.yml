description: 'Data transmitted over a network, whether wired or wireless, is susceptible

    to passive monitoring. Whenever practical solutions for encrypting

    such data exist, they should be applied. Even if data is expected to

    be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be encrypted.

    Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is particularly

    important. Networks of Oracle Linux 8 machines can and should be configured

    so that no unencrypted authentication data is ever transmitted between

    machines.'

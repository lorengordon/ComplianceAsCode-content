description: 'Several tools exist which can be effectively used to improve a system''s

    resistance to and detection of unknown attacks. These tools can improve

    robustness against attack at the cost of relatively little configuration

    effort. In particular, this guide recommends and discusses the use of

    host-based firewalling, SELinux for protection against

    vulnerable services, and a logging and auditing infrastructure for

    detection of problems.'

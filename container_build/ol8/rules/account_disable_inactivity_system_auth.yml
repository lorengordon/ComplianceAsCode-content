description: 'Verify the account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices)
    are disabled after

    <sub idref="var_account_disable_inactivity" /> or less days of inactivity by

    checking the account inactivity value with the following command:

    <pre>grep ''inactive\|pam_unix'' /etc/pam.d/password-auth | grep -w auth


    auth required pam_lastlog.so inactive=35

    auth sufficient pam_unix.so</pre>

    The line with the inactive parameter should be placed before <tt>pam_unix.so</tt>
    module as in

    the example output.'
rationale: 'Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers
    may exploit an

    inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system. Owners
    of inactive

    accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been
    obtained.'

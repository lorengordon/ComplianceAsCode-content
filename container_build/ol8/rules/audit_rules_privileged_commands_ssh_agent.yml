description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect any execution attempt

    of the <tt>ssh-agent</tt> command for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt>

    daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules

    during daemon startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/ssh-agent -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -k privileged-ssh-agent</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/ssh-agent -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -k privileged-ssh-agent</pre>'
rationale: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and

    mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,

    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify

    those responsible for one.


    Audit records can be generated from various components within the

    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).'

            Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
            system (e.g., module or policy filter).


            When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is
            being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid
            set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which
            equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset"
            in the same way.


            The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts
            each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very
            important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these
            affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The
            performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule
            whenever possible.'

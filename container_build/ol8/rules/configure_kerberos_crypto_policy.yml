description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    Kerberos is supported by crypto policy, but it''s configuration may be

    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings for Kerberos are configured correctly,
    examine that there is a symlink at

    /etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies targeting /etc/cypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config.

    If the symlink exists, Kerberos is configured to use the system-wide crypto policy
    settings.'
rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of Kerberos violate
    expectations,

    and makes system configuration more fragmented.'

description: 'In the default graphical environment, screen locking on smartcard removal

    can be enabled by setting <tt>removal-action</tt>

    to <tt>''lock-screen''</tt>.

    <br /><br />

    To enable, add or edit <tt>removal-action</tt> to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard]

    removal-action=''lock-screen''</pre>

    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user
    modification.

    For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard/removal-action</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'Locking the screen automatically when removing the smartcard can

    prevent undesired access to system.'

        srg_requirement: Oracle Linux 8 must prevent a user from overriding the disabling
            of the graphical user martcard removal action.
        vuldiscussion: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops
            work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
            system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of
            the absence.


            The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can
            be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire
            before the user session can be locked, Oracle Linux 8 needs to provide
            users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can
            secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate
            physical vicinity.'

            Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system,
            so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if
            a database other than "local" is being used.


            $ grep ''removal-action'' /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*


            /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard/removal-action

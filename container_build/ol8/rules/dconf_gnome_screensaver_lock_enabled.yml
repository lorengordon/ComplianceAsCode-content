description: '

    To activate locking of the screensaver in the GNOME3 desktop when it is activated,

    add or set <tt>lock-enabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]

    lock-enabled=true

    </pre>

    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user
    modification.

    For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-enabled</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
    moves away from the immediate physical vicinity

    of the information system but does not want to logout because of the temporary
    nature of the absense.'

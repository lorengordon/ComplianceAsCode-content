description: fapolicyd needs be configured so that users cannot give access to their
    home folders to other users.
rationale: 'Users'' home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive
    nature.

    Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with a System
    Administrator (SA) through shared resources.

    fapolicyd can confine users to their home directory, not allowing them to make
    any changes outside of their own home directories.

    Confining users to their home directory will minimize the risk of sharing information.'

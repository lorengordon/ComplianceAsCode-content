description: 'If the SSH server is in use, inbound connections to SSH''s port should
    be allowed to permit

    remote access through SSH. In more restrictive firewalld settings, the SSH port
    should be

    added to the proper firewalld zone in order to allow SSH remote access.

    <br /><br />




    To configure <code>firewalld</code> to allow <code>ssh</code> access, run the
    following command(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh</pre>


    Then run the following command to load the newly created rule(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>'
rationale: 'If inbound SSH connections are expected, adding the SSH port to the proper
    firewalld zone

    will allow remote access through the SSH port.'

-   general: 'The remediation for this rule uses <tt>firewall-cmd</tt> and <tt>nmcli</tt>
        tools.

        Therefore, it will only be executed if <tt>firewalld</tt> and <tt>NetworkManager</tt>

        services are running. Otherwise, the remediation will be aborted and a informative
        message

        will be shown in the remediation report.

        These respective services will not be started in order to preserve any intentional
        change

        in network components related to firewall and network interfaces.'
-   general: 'This rule also checks if the SSH port was modified by the administrator
        in the firewalld

        services definitions and is reflecting the expected port number. Although
        this is checked,

        fixing the custom ssh.xml file placed by the administrator at /etc/firewalld/services
        it

        is not in the scope of the remediation since there is no reliable way to manually
        change

        the respective file. If the default SSH port is modified, it is on the administrator

        responsibility to ensure the firewalld customizations in the service port
        level are

        properly configured.'

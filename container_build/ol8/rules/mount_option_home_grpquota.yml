description: 'The <tt>grpquota</tt> mount option allows for the filesystem to have
    disk quotas configured.

    Add the <code>grpquota</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/home</code>.'
rationale: 'To ensure the availability of disk space on /home, it is important to
    limit the impact a

    single user or group can cause for other users (or the wider system) by intentionally
    or

    accidentally filling up the partition. Quotas can also be applied to inodes for
    filesystems

    where inode exhaustion is a concern.'

srg_requirement: Oracle Linux 8 must mount /home with the grpquota option.
warnings:
-   general: 'The quota options for XFS file systems can only be activated when mounting
        the partition.

        It is not possible to enable them by remounting an already mounted partition.
        Therefore,

        if the desired options were not defined before mounting the partition, dismount
        and mount

        it again to apply the quota options.'
-   functionality: 'OVAL looks for partitions whose mount point is a substring of
        any interactive user''s home

        directory and validates that grpquota option is there. Because of this, there
        could be

        false negatives when several partitions share a base substring. For example,
        if there is a

        home directory in <tt>/var/tmp/user1</tt> and there are partitions mounted
        in

        <tt>/var</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The grpquota option is only expected
        in

        <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, but OVAL will check both.<br/>

        Bash remediation uses the <tt>df</tt> command to find out the partition where
        the home

        directory is mounted. However, if the directory doesn''t exist the remediation
        won''t be

        applied.'

description: 'The <code>quagga</code> package can be removed with the following command:
    <pre> $ sudo yum erase quagga</pre>'
rationale: 'Routing software is typically used on routers to exchange network topology
    information

    with other routers. If routing software is used when not required, system network

    information may be unnecessarily transmitted across the network.

    <br />

    If there is no need to make the router software available,

    removing it provides a safeguard against its activation.'

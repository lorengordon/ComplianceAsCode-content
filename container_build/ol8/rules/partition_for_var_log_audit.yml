description: 'Audit logs are stored in the <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> directory.


    Ensure that <code>/var/log/audit</code> has its own partition or logical

    volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

    Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all

    audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.'
rationale: 'Placing <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> in its own partition

    enables better separation between audit files

    and other files, and helps ensure that

    auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out

    of space.'

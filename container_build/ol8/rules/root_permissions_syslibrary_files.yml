description: 'System-wide library files are stored in the following directories

    by default:

    <pre>/lib

    /lib64

    /usr/lib

    /usr/lib64

    </pre>

    All system-wide shared library files should be protected from unauthorised

    access. If any of these files is not group-owned by root, correct its group-owner
    with

    the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>FILE</i></pre>'
rationale: 'If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software
    libraries,

    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing
    and

    approvals that are part of a robust change management process.


    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are

    accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software
    libraries

    also include privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only
    qualified

    and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system
    components

    for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'

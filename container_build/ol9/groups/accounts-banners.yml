description: 'Each system should expose as little information about

    itself as possible.

    <br /><br />

    System banners, which are typically displayed just before a

    login prompt, give out information about the service or the host''s

    operating system. This might include the distribution name and the

    system kernel version, and the particular version of a network

    service. This information can assist intruders in gaining access to

    the system as it can reveal whether the system is running

    vulnerable software. Most network services can be configured to

    limit what information is displayed.

    <br /><br />

    Many organizations implement security policies that require a

    system banner provide notice of the system''s ownership, provide

    warning to unauthorized users, and remind authorized users of their

    consent to monitoring.'

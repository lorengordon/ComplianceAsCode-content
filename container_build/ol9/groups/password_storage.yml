description: 'By default, password hashes for local accounts are stored

    in the second field (colon-separated) in

    <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>. This file should be readable only by

    processes running with root credentials, preventing users from

    casually accessing others'' password hashes and attempting

    to crack them.

    However, it remains possible to misconfigure the system

    and store password hashes

    in world-readable files such as <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, or

    to even store passwords themselves in plaintext on the system.

    Using system-provided tools for password change/creation

    should allow administrators to avoid such misconfiguration.'

description: 'The simplest way to avoid vulnerabilities in software is to avoid

    installing that software. On Oracle Linux 9,the RPM Package Manager (originally
    Red Hat Package Manager, abbreviated RPM)

    allows for careful management of

    the set of software packages installed on a system. Installed software

    contributes to system vulnerability in several ways. Packages that

    include setuid programs may provide local attackers a potential path to

    privilege escalation. Packages that include network services may give

    this opportunity to network-based attackers. Packages that include

    programs which are predictably executed by local users (e.g. after

    graphical login) may provide opportunities for trojan horses or other

    attack code to be run undetected. The number of software packages

    installed on a system can almost always be significantly pruned to include

    only the software for which there is an environmental or operational need.'

description: 'Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation

    procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts. In the event

    temporary accounts are required, configure the system to

    terminate them after a documented time period. For every temporary account, run
    the following command to set an expiration date on

    it, substituting <tt><i>USER</i></tt> and <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt>

    appropriately:

    <pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD USER</i></pre>

    <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt> indicates the documented expiration date for the

    account. For U.S. Government systems, the operating system must be

    configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a

    period of 72 hours.'
rationale: 'If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for

    an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access.

    To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts

    must be set upon account creation.

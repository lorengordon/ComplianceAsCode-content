description: 'Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are
    set.

    Changing login UIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities
    which

    are not available to unprivileged users.


    The following rules configure audit as described above:

    <pre>## Make the loginuid immutable. This prevents tampering with the auid.

    --loginuid-immutable    </pre>


    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:

    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>'
rationale: 'If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by
    unprivileged users and

    make auditing complicated or impossible.'

description: 'To configure Audit daemon to issue an explicit flush to disk command

    after writing <sub idref="var_auditd_freq" /> records, set <tt>freq</tt> to <tt><sub
    idref="var_auditd_freq" /></tt>

    in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>.'
rationale: 'If option <tt>freq</tt> isn''t set to <tt><sub idref="var_auditd_freq"
    /></tt>, the flush to disk

    may happen after higher number of records, increasing the danger

    of audit loss.'

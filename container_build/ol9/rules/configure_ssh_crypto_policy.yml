description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    SSH is supported by crypto policy, but the SSH configuration may be

    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that

    the <tt>CRYPTO_POLICY</tt> variable is either commented or not set at all

    in the <tt>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</tt>.'
rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the SSH service
    violate expectations,

    and makes system configuration more fragmented.'

description: 'By default, DConf uses a binary database as a data backend.

    The system-level database is compiled from keyfiles in the /etc/dconf/db/

    directory by the <pre>dconf update</pre> command. More specifically, content present

    in the following directories:

    <pre>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d</pre>

    <pre>/etc/dconf/db/local.d</pre>'
rationale: 'Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check
    by OVAL.

    Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the
    same time -

    configuration files have to be compliant, and the database needs to be more recent
    than those keyfiles,

    which gives confidence that it reflects them.'

description: 'System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables

    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

    by default:

    <pre>/lib

    /lib64

    /usr/lib

    /usr/lib64

    </pre>

    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also

    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories should be

    group-owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. If the  directories, is found to be owned

    by a user other than root correct its

    ownership with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>DIR</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address

    space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at

    runtime. Proper ownership of library directories is necessary to protect

    the integrity of the system.'

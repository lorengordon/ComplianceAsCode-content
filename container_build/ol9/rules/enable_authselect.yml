description: 'Configure user authentication setup to use the <tt>authselect</tt> tool.

    If authselect profile is selected, the rule will enable the <sub idref="var_authselect_profile"
    /> profile.'
rationale: 'Authselect is a successor to authconfig.

    It is a tool to select system authentication and identity sources from a list
    of supported

    profiles instead of letting the administrator manually build the PAM stack.


    That way, it avoids potential breakage of configuration, as it ships several tested
    profiles

    that are well tested and supported to solve different use-cases.'

warnings:
-   general: 'If the <tt>sudo authselect select</tt> command returns an error informing
        that the chosen

        profile cannot be selected, it is probably because PAM files have already
        been modified by

        the administrator. If this is the case, in order to not overwrite the desired
        changes made

        by the administrator, the current PAM settings should be investigated before
        forcing the

        selection of the chosen authselect profile.'

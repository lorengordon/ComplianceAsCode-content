    Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the

    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf

    hosts: files dns</pre>

    If the DNS entry is missing from the host''s line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf"

    file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.

    Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf</pre>

    If the DNS entry is found on the host''s line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file,

    then verify the following:<br/>


    Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured

    in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. This provides redundant name resolution services

    in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain

    as least <tt>2</tt> DNS servers, add a corresponding <tt>nameserver

    <i>ip_address</i></tt> entry in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> for each DNS

    server where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of a valid DNS server.

    For example:

    <pre>search example.com

    nameserver 192.168.0.1

    nameserver 192.168.0.2</pre>'
rationale: 'To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant

    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the

    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include

    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.'

    this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations.


    If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or

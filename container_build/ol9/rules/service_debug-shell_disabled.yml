description: 'SystemD''s <tt>debug-shell</tt> service is intended to

    diagnose SystemD related boot issues with various <tt>systemctl</tt>

    commands. Once enabled and following a system reboot, the root shell

    will be available on <tt>tty9</tt> which is access by pressing

    <tt>CTRL-ALT-F9</tt>. The <tt>debug-shell</tt> service should only be used

    for SystemD related issues and should otherwise be disabled.

    <br /><br />

    By default, the <tt>debug-shell</tt> SystemD service is already disabled.


    The <code>debug-shell</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now debug-shell.service</pre>'
rationale: 'This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
    security

    on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root

    access when the system is rebooted.'

ocil: 'To check that the <code>debug-shell</code> service is disabled in system boot
    configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>debug-shell</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>debug-shell</code> service has either not been
    installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>debug-shell</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>debug-shell</code> is not active (i.e.
    not running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active debug-shell</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>debug-shell</code> is
    masked, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>debug-shell</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'

            privileges to anyone who has physical access to the machine.  While this
            feature is disabled by default, masking it adds an additional layer of
            assurance that it will not be enabled via a dependency in systemd.  This
            also prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
            security on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and
            gaining root access when the system is rebooted.

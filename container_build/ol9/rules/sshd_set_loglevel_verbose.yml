description: 'The <tt>VERBOSE</tt> parameter configures the SSH daemon to record login
    and logout activity.

    To specify the log level in

    SSH, add or correct the following line in



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>'
rationale: 'SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
    <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically

    not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it
    provides

    so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
    <tt>INFO</tt> or

    <tt>VERBOSE</tt> level is the basic level that only records login activity of
    SSH users. In many

    situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular
    user was active

    on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which
    helps narrow the

    field.'

description: 'By default on Oracle Linux 9 64-bit systems, ExecShield is

    enabled and can only be disabled if the hardware does not support

    ExecShield or is disabled in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>.




    For Oracle Linux 9  32-bit systems, <tt>sysctl</tt> can be used to enable

    ExecShield.'
rationale: 'ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent

    execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as

    a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be

    executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process''s memory

    regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware

    prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the

    latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.'

ocil_clause: ExecShield is not supported by the hardware, is not enabled, or has been
    disabled by the kernel configuration.
ocil: 'To verify ExecShield is enabled on 64-bit Oracle Linux 9 systems,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ dmesg | grep ''[NX|DX]*protection''</pre>

    The output should not contain <tt>''disabled by kernel command line option''</tt>.

    Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system

    in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. If it includes <tt>noexec=off</tt>,

    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.

    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*noexec=off.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*noexec=off.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>.Moreover,
    command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.

    Run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v ''noexec=off''</pre>

    The command should not return any output.




    For 32-bit Oracle Linux 9 systems, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sysctl kernel.exec-shield</pre>

    The output should be:

    To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.exec-shield</code> kernel parameter,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.exec-shield=1</pre>


    To make sure that the setting is persistent,

    add the following line to a file in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>:

    <pre>kernel.exec-shield = 1</pre>'

description: 'To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server,

    open <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and read and understand the last section of the
    file,

    which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote

    logging.

    Along with these other directives, the system can be configured

    to forward its logs to a particular log server by

    adding or correcting one of the following lines,

    substituting <tt><i><sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address" /></i></tt> appropriately.

    The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system;

    although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,

    they may not be supported in all environments.

    <br />

    To use UDP for log message delivery:

    <pre>*.* @<i><sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address" /></i></pre>

    <br />

    To use TCP for log message delivery:

    <pre>*.* @@<i><sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address" /></i></pre>

    <br />

    To use RELP for log message delivery:

    <pre>*.* :omrelp:<i><sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address" /></i></pre>

    <br />

    There must be a resolvable DNS CNAME or Alias record set to "<sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"
    />" for logs to be sent correctly to the centralized logging utility.'
rationale: 'A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more

    systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a

    system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages

    to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized

    place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.'

            Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit
            storage capacity.


            openSUSE installation media provides "rsyslogd".  "rsyslogd" is a system
            utility providing support for message logging.  Support for both internet
            and UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and
            remote logging.  Couple this utility with "gnutls" (which is a secure
            communications library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols),
            and you have a method to securely encrypt and off-load auditing.


            Rsyslog provides three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP transport,
            which is extremely lossy but standard; the plain TCP based transport,
            which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely available;
            and the RELP transport, which does not lose messages but is currently
            available only as part of the rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.

            Examples of each configuration:

            UDP *.* @remotesystemname

            TCP *.* @@remotesystemname

            RELP *.* :omrelp:remotesystemname:2514

            Note that a port number was given as there is no standard port for RELP.'

description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect any execution attempt

    of the <tt>setfiles</tt> command for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt>

    daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules

    during daemon startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setfiles -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setfiles -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=privileged</pre>'
rationale: 'Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally
    by

    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system
    accounts,

    is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.

    Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and
    identify

    the risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.

    <br /><br />

    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,

    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but

    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for

    unusual activity.'

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
    system (e.g., module or policy filter).


    The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated.
    This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the
    system is capable of generating audit records.


    DoD has defined the list of events for which the operating system will provide
    an audit record generation capability as the following:


    1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges,
    security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification
    levels);


    2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged
    activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access
    to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful
    accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information
    system;


    3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and


    4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.'

        vuldiscussion: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the
            security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult
            to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident
            or identify those responsible for one.


            Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
            system (e.g., module or policy filter).


            When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is
            being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid
            set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which
            equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset"
            in the same way.


            The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts
            each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very
            important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these
            affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The
            performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule
            whenever possible.'

description: 'The <tt>port</tt> option in <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt> can be set to

    <tt>0</tt> to make chrony daemon to never open any listening port

    for server operation and to operate strictly in a client-only mode.'
rationale: 'In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer
    of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within
    data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical
    and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.
    Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to
    support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient
    to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however,
    doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating
    system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential
    capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only
    those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address
    authorized quality of life issues.'

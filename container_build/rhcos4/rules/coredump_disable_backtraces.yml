description: 'The <tt>ProcessSizeMax</tt> option in <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section

    of <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>

    specifies the maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed.

    Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the backtrace will not

    be generated.'
rationale: 'A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system

    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data

    and is generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to

    debug problems.


    Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended,

    however there may be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced

    debuging. Permitting temporary enablement of core dumps during such situations

    should be reviewed through local needs and policy.'

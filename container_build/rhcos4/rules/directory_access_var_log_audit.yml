description: 'The audit system should collect access events to read audit log directory.

    The following audit rule will assure that access to audit log directory are

    collected.

    <pre>-a always,exit -F dir=/var/log/audit/ -F perm=r -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset
    -F key=access-audit-trail</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt>

    program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the

    rule to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory

    <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the rule to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.'
rationale: 'Attempts to read the logs should be recorded, suspicious access to audit
    log files could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system.

    Auditing these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.'''

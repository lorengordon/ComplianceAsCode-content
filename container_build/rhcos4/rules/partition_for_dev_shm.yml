description: "The <tt>/dev/shm</tt> is a traditional shared memory concept. \nOne\
    \ program will create a memory portion, which other processes \n(if permitted)\
    \ can access. If <tt>/dev/shm</tt> is not configured, \ntmpfs will be mounted\
    \ to /dev/shm by systemd."
rationale: "Any user can upload and execute files inside the <tt>/dev/shm</tt> similar\
    \ to \nthe <tt>/tmp</tt> partition. Configuring <tt>/dev/shm</tt> allows an administrator\
    \ \nto set the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker\
    \ to \ninstall executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing\
    \ a \nhardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once\
    \ the program \nwas updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would\
    \ have his own copy \nof the program. If the program happened to have a security\
    \ vulnerability, the attacker \ncould continue to exploit the known flaw."

ocil: 'You''ll need to log into a node in the cluster.

    As a user with administrator privileges, log into a node in the relevant pool:

    <pre>

    $ oc debug node/$NODE_NAME

    </pre>

    At the <pre>sh-4.4#</pre> prompt, run:

    <pre>

    # chroot /host

    Subsequently,Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for
    <code>/dev/shm</code> with the following command:


    <pre>$ mountpoint /dev/shm</pre>

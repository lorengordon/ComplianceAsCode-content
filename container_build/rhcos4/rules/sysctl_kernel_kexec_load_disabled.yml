description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled</code>
    kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</pre>

    To make sure that the setting is persistent, add the following line to a file
    in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>: <pre>kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1</pre>'
rationale: 'Disabling kexec_load allows greater control of the kernel memory.

    It makes it impossible to load another kernel image after it has been disabled.

            at all costs especially since it can load unsigned kernel images.'

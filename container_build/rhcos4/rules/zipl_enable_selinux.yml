description: 'To ensure SELinux is not disabled at boot time,

    check that no boot entry in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> has <tt>selinux=0</tt>

    included in its options.<br />'
rationale: 'Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time
    prevents

    it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases

    the chances that it will remain off during system operation.'

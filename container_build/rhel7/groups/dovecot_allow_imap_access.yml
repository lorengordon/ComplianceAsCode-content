    The default <tt>firewalld</tt> configuration does not allow inbound

    access to any services. This modification will allow remote hosts to

    initiate connections to the IMAP daemon, while keeping all other ports

    on the server in their default protected state.



    To configure <code>firewalld</code> to allow <code>143/tcp</code> access, run
    the following command(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=143/tcp</pre>



    Then run the following command to load the newly created rule(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>'

description: "SELinux is a feature of the Linux kernel which can be\nused to guard\
    \ against misconfigured or compromised programs.\nSELinux enforces the idea that\
    \ programs should be limited in what\nfiles they can access and what actions they\
    \ can take.\n<br /><br />\nThe default SELinux policy, as configured on Red Hat\
    \ Enterprise Linux 7, has been\nsufficiently developed and debugged that it should\
    \ be usable on\nalmost any system with minimal configuration and a small\namount\
    \ of system administrator training. This policy prevents\nsystem services - including\
    \ most of the common network-visible\nservices such as mail servers, FTP servers,\
    \ and DNS servers - from\naccessing files which those services have no valid reason\
    \ to\naccess. This action alone prevents a huge amount of possible damage\nfrom\
    \ network attacks against services, from trojaned software, and\nso forth.\n<br\
    \ /><br />\nThis guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the\ndefault (targeted)\
    \ policy on every Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system, unless that\nsystem has unusual\
    \ requirements which make a stronger policy\nappropriate.\n\n<br /><br />\nFor\
    \ more information on SELinux, see <b>\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\

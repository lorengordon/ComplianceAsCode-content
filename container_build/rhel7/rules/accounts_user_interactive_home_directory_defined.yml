description: 'Assign home directories to all interactive users that currently do not

    have a home directory assigned.


    This rule checks if the home directory is properly defined in a folder which has

    at least one parent folder, like "user" in "/home/user" or "/remote/users/user".

    Therefore, this rule will report a finding for home directories like <tt>/users</tt>,

    <tt>/tmp</tt> or <tt>/</tt>.'
rationale: 'If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there
    is no

    place for the storage and control of files they should own.'

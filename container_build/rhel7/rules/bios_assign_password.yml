description: 'Assign a password to the system boot firmware (historically called BIOS
    on PC

    systems) to require a password for any configuration changes.'
rationale: 'Assigning a password to the system boot firmware prevents anyone

    with physical access from configuring the system to boot

    from local media and circumvent the operating system''s access controls.

    For systems in physically secure locations, such as

    a data center or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), this risk
    must be weighed

    against the risk of administrative personnel being unable to conduct recovery
    operations in

    a timely fashion.'

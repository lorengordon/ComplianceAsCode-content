description: 'Reboot the system and enter the BIOS or Setup configuration menu.

    Navigate the BIOS configuration menu and make sure that the option is enabled.
    The setting may be located

    under a Security section. Look for Execute Disable (XD) on Intel-based systems
    and No Execute (NX)

    on AMD-based systems.'
rationale: 'Computers with the ability to prevent this type of code execution frequently
    put an option in the BIOS that will

    allow users to turn the feature on or off at will.'

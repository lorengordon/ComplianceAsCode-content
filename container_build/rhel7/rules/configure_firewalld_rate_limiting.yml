description: 'Create a direct firewall rule to protect against DoS attacks with the
    following

    command:

    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT_direct
    0 -p tcp -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst 100  -j INPUT_ZONES</pre>'
rationale: 'DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users.
    When

    this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must

    operate at degraded capacity.

    <br /><br />

    This requirement addresses the configuration of

    the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred
    or

    are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS

    attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety
    of

    technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS

    attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing

    increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce

    the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.'

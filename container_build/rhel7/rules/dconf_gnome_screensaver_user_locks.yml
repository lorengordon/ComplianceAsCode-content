description: 'If not already configured, ensure that users cannot change GNOME3 screensaver
    lock settings

    by adding <tt>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay</tt>

    to <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user
    modification.

    For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops
    work and moves away from the immediate

    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the
    temporary nature of the absence.

    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session
    prior to vacating the vicinity,

    GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user''s session has idled
    and take action to initiate the

    session lock. As such, users should not be allowed to change session settings.'

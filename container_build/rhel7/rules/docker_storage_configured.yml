description: 'To use Docker in production with the device mapper storage driver, the
    Docker

    daemon should be configured to use direct-lvm instead of loopback device as

    a storage. For setting up the LVM and configuring Docker, see the

    <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/''>Docker
    Device Mapper Storage Documentation</a>.'
rationale: 'For using Docker in production, the device mapper storage driver with
    loopback

    devices is discouraged. The suggested way of configuring device mapper storage

    driver is direct-lvm. Choosing the right storage driver and backing filesystem

    is crucial to stability and performance.'

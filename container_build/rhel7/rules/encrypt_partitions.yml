description: "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through\
    \ the\nLinux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way\
    \ to\nencrypt a partition is during installation time.\n<br /><br />\nFor manual\
    \ installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during\npartition creation\
    \ to encrypt the partition. When this\noption is selected the system will prompt\
    \ for a passphrase to use in\ndecrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently\
    \ need to be entered manually\nevery time the system boots.\n\n<br /><br />\n\
    For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding\n\
    the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition\
    \ of each partition to be\nencrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt\
    \ the root partition:\n<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted\
    \ --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>\nAny <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the\
    \ Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart\nmust then be protected accordingly.\n\
    Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will\
    \ cause the\ninstaller to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during\
    \ installation.\n<br /><br />\nBy default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses\
    \ <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher\nwith a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which\
    \ should be compatible with FIPS enabled.\n\n<br /><br />\nDetailed information\
    \ on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on\nthe Red\
    \ Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Documentation web site:<br />\n\n    \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\

rationale: 'The risk of a system''s physical compromise, particularly mobile systems
    such as

    laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates

    the risk of its loss if the system is lost.'

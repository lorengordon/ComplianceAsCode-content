description: 'To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages

    come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them),

    the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To install the Red Hat GPG

    key, run:

    <pre>$ sudo subscription-manager register</pre>


    If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then

    install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as the Red Hat

    installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted in

    <tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import

    it into the keyring:

    <pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>


    Alternatively, the key may be pre-loaded during the RHEL installation. In

    such cases, the key can be installed by running the following command:

    <pre>sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release</pre>'
rationale: 'Changes to software components can have significant effects on the overall

    security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has

    not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

    The Red Hat GPG key is necessary to cryptographically verify packages are

    from Red Hat.'

            the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided
            by a trusted vendor.


            Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
            components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
            the organization.


            Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates
            the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies
            the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided
            by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement.
            The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This
            requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,
            the certificate used to verify the software must be from Red Hat.'

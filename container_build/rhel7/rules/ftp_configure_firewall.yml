    By default, <tt>firewalld</tt>

    blocks access to the ports used by the web server.





    To configure <code>firewalld</code> to allow <code>ftp</code> access, run the
    following command(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ftp</pre>


    Then run the following command to load the newly created rule(s):

    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>'
rationale: 'These settings configure the firewall to allow connections to an FTP server.



    The first line allows initial connections to the FTP server port.

    FTP is an older protocol which is not very compatible with firewalls. During the
    initial FTP dialogue, the client

    and server negotiate an arbitrary port to be used for data transfer. The <tt>ip_conntrack_ftp</tt>  module
    is used by

    iptables to listen to that dialogue and allow connections to the data ports which
    FTP negotiates. This allows an

    FTP server to operate on a system which is running a firewall.'

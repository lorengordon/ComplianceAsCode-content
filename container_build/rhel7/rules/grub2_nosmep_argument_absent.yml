description: 'The SMEP is used to prevent the supervisor mode from executing user
    space code,

    it is enabled by default since Linux kernel 3.0. But it could be disabled through

    kernel boot parameters.


    Ensure that Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) is not disabled by

    the <tt>nosmep</tt> boot paramenter option.


    Check that the line <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="..."</pre> within <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>

    doesn''t contain the argument <tt>nosmep</tt>.

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:

    <pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="nosmep"</pre>'
rationale: 'Disabling SMEP can facilitate exploitation of certain vulnerabilities
    because it allows

    the kernel to unintentionally execute code in less privileged memory space.'

ocil_clause: the kernel is configured to disable SMEP
ocil: 'Make sure that the kernel is not disabling SMEP with the following

    commands.

    <pre>grep -q nosmep /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>

    If the command returns a line, it means that SMEP is being disabled.'

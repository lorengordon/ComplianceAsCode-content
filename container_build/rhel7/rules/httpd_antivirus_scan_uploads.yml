description: 'Install anti-virus software on the system and set it to automatically
    scan new

    files that are introduced to the web server.'
rationale: 'Remote web authors should not be able to upload files to the Document
    Root

    directory structure without virus checking and checking for malicious or mobile

    code. A remote web user, whose agency has a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with

    the hosting agency and has submitted a DoD form 2875 (System Authorization

    Access Request (SAAR)) or an equivalent document, will be allowed to post files

    to a temporary location on the server. All posted files to this temporary

    location will be scanned for viruses and content checked for malicious or mobile

    code. Only files free of viruses and malicious or mobile code will be posted to

    the appropriate DocumentRoot directory.'

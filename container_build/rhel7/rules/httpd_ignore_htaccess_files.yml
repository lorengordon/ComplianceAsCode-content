rationale: 'CGI scripts represents one of the most common and exploitable means of

    compromising a web server. By definition, CGI are executable by the operating

    system of the host server. While access control is provided via the web service,

    the execution of CGI programs is not otherwise limited unless the SA or Web

    Manager takes specific measures. CGI programs can access and alter data files,

    launch other programs and use the network. CGI programs can be written in any

    available programming language. C, PERL, PHP, Javascript, VBScript and shell

    (sh, ksh, bash) are popular choices.'

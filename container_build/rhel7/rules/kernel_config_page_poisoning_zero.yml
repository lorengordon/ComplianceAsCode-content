description: "Instead of using the existing poison value, fill the pages with zeros.\
    \ This makes it harder to\ndetect when errors are occurring due to sanitization\
    \ but the zeroing at free means that it is\nno longer necessary to write zeros\
    \ when GFP_ZERO is used on allocation.\nThis configuration is available from kernel\
    \ 4.19.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This configuration helps alleviates the performance impact of poisonining.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

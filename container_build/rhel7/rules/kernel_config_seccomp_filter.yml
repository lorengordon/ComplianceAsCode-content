description: "Enable tasks to build secure computing environments defined in terms\
    \ of Berkeley Packet Filter\nprograms which implement task-defined system call\
    \ filtering polices.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available\
    \ at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'Use of BPF filters allows for expressive filtering of system calls using
    a filter program

    language with a long history of being exposed to userland.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

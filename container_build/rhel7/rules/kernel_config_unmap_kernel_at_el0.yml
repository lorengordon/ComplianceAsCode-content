description: "Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can be\
    \ used to bypass MMU\npermission checks and leak kernel data to userspace. This\
    \ can be defended against by unmapping\nthe kernel when running in userspace,\
    \ mapping it back in on exception entry via a trampoline\npage in the vector table.\n\
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.16, but may be available if backported\n\
    by distros.\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This is a countermeasure to the Meltdown attack.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

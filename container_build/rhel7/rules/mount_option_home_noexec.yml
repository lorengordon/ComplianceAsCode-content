description: 'The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries from
    being

    executed out of <tt>/home</tt>.

    Add the <code>noexec</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/home</code>.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/home</tt> directory contains data of individual users. Binaries
    in

    this directory should not be considered as trusted and users should not be

    able to execute them.'

        srg_requirement: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 must prevent code from being executed
            on file systems that contain user home directories.
        vuldiscussion: The "noexec" mount option causes the system to not execute
            binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not
            containing approved binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing
            files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged
            users to attain unauthorized administrative access.

            Note: If a separate file system has not been created for the user home
            directories (user home directories are mounted under "/"), this is automatically
            a finding as the "noexec" option cannot be used on the "/" system.

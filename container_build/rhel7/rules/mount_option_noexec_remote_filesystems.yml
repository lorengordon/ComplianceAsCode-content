description: 'Add the <code>noexec</code> option to the fourth column of <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>
    for the line which controls mounting of

    any NFS mounts.'
rationale: 'The noexec mount option causes the system not to execute binary files.
    This option must be used

    for mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may
    be incompatible. Executing

    files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users
    to attain unauthorized

    administrative access.'

-   general: 'This rule does not come with remediation as there is no one way to solve
        the problem, and

        the requirement from CIS specification does not require one particular way,
        but persuades

        the system administrator to perform configuration suitable for the specific
        environment.

        This also means that the OVAL check is too generic, and the user most probably
        should

        perform additional manual verification.'

description: '

    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,

    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:

    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>

    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form
    of RPM packages)

    can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.


    <br /><br />

    NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner
    as local policy

    dictates.'
rationale: 'Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against

    the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most

    recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized

    users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The

    lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.'

    Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for

    It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on
    the system if the underlying packages are not installed.



    Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system
    with the following command:


    $ sudo yum history list | more

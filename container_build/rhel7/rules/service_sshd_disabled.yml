description: 'The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.

    However, if it can be disabled, do so.



    The <code>sshd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now sshd.service</pre>


    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated

    remote access.'

description: 'Limit the key exchange algorithms to those  which are FIPS-approved.

    Add or modify the following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>

    <pre>KexAlgorithms ecdh-sha1-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</pre>

    This rule ensures that only the key exchange algorithms mentioned

    above (or their subset) are configured for use, keeping the given

    order of algorithms.'
rationale: 'DoD information systems are required to use FIPS-approved key exchange
    algorithms.

    The system will attempt to use the first algorithm presented by the client that
    matches

    the server list. Listing the values "strongest to weakest" is a method to ensure
    the use

    of the strongest algorithm available to secure the SSH connection.'

-   general: The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
-   regulatory: 'System crypto modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this requirements, the system has to have cryptographic software

        provided by a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means

        providing documentation, test results, design information, and independent

        third party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

description: 'Limit the MACs to those hash algorithms which are FIPS-approved.

    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>

    demonstrates use of FIPS-approved MACs:

    <pre>MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256</pre>

    This rule ensures that there are configured MACs mentioned

    above (or their subset), keeping the given order of algorithms.'
rationale: 'DoD Information Systems are required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic
    hash

    functions. The only SSHv2 hash algorithms meeting this requirement is SHA2.'

-   general: The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

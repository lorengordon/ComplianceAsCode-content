      <title>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must initiate a session lock for the screensaver after a period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.</title>
      <description>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
session lock.
<html:br/><html:br/>
Enabling idle activation of the screensaver ensures the screensaver will
be activated after the idle delay.  Applications requiring continuous,
real-time screen display (such as network management products) require the
login session does not have administrator rights and the display station is located in a
controlled-access area.</description>

        <check-content>Verify Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 audits the execution of privileged functions.

Check if Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call using the following command:

$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules

The output should be the following:


-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k setuid
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k setuid
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k setgid
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k setgid
      Is it the case that the command does not return all lines, or the lines are commented out?

If audit is using the "auditctl" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

<html:pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</html:pre>

If audit is using the "augenrules" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

<html:pre>$ sudo grep -r execve /etc/audit/rules.d</html:pre>


<html:pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k setuid</html:pre>

If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules for "SUID" files are not defined, this is a finding.

      <description>In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information,
or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must
disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information
systems.
<html:br/><html:br/>
Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services.
Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support
essential organizational operations.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component
(e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by
one component.
<html:br/><html:br/>
To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must
support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the
use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to
conduct official business.</description>

      <title>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all wireless network adapters are disabled.</title>
      <description>The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into
the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association
and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point
(AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the
attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also
serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of
service to valid network resources.</description>
      <check system="C-204634_chk">
        <check-content>Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system
with the following command:

Note: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.

$ nmcli device status

      <title>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must protect audit information from unauthorized read, modification, or deletion.</title>
      <description>If users can write to audit logs, audit trails can be modified or destroyed.</description>
      <check system="C-228564_chk">
        <check-content>Run the following command to check the mode of the system audit logs:

$ sudo stat -c "%n %a" /var/log/audit/*
$ sudo ls -l /var/log/audit

Determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:
<html:pre>$ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</html:pre>
Configure the audit log to be protected from unauthorized read access by setting the correct
permissive mode with the following command:
<html:pre>$ sudo chmod 0600 <html:i>audit_log_file</html:i></html:pre>
By default, <html:i>audit_log_file</html:i> is "/var/log/audit/audit.log".</fixtext>

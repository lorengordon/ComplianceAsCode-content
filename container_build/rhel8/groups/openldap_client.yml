description: 'This section provides information on which security settings are

    important to configure in OpenLDAP clients by manually editing the appropriate

    configuration files.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 provides an automated configuration
    tool called

    authconfig and a graphical wrapper for authconfig called

    <tt>system-config-authentication</tt>. However, these tools do not provide as

    much control over configuration as manual editing of configuration files. The

    authconfig tools do not allow you to specify locations of SSL certificate

    files, which is useful when trying to use SSL cleanly across several protocols.

    Installation and configuration of OpenLDAP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is available

description: 'If the SSH server is expected to only receive connections from

    the local network, then strengthen the default firewall rule for the SSH service

    to only accept connections from the appropriate network segment(s).

    <br /><br />

    Determine an appropriate network block, <tt>netwk</tt>, network mask, <tt>mask</tt>,
    and

    network protocol, <tt>ip_protocol</tt>, representing the systems on your network
    which will

    be allowed to access this SSH server.

    <br /><br />

    Run the following command:

    <pre>firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule=''rule family="ip_protocol" source
    address="netwk/mask" service name="ssh" accept''</pre>'

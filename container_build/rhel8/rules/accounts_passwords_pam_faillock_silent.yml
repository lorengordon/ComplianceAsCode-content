description: 'This rule ensures the system prevents informative messages from being
    presented to the user

    pertaining to logon information after a number of incorrect login attempts using

    <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>.


    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must
    be carefully

    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid errors when manually editing these
    files, it is

    recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,

    depending on the OS version.'
rationale: 'The pam_faillock module without the silent option will leak information
    about the existence or

    non-existence of a user account in the system because the failures are not recorded
    for unknown

    users. The message about the user account being locked is never displayed for
    non-existing user

    accounts allowing the adversary to infer that a particular account exists or not
    on the system.'

warnings:
-   general: 'If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings,
        the remediation

        will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification
        was made in

        PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation
        will be

        aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative
        message will

        be shown in the remediation report.

        If the system supports the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file, the
        pam_faillock

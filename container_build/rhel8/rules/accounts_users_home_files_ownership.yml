description: 'Either remove all files and directories from the system that

    do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned

    files and directories. To assign a valid owner to a local

    interactive user''s files and directories, use the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chown -R <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>


    This rule ensures every file or directory under the home directory related

    to an interactive user is owned by an interactive user.'
rationale: 'If local interactive users do not own the files in their directories,

    unauthorized users may be able to access them. Additionally, if files are not

    owned by the user, this could be an indication of system compromise.'

description: 'The <tt>maxpoll</tt> should be configured to

    <sub idref="var_time_service_set_maxpoll" /> in <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> or

    <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt> to continuously poll time servers. To configure

    <tt>maxpoll</tt> in <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> or <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt>

    add the following after each `server`, `pool` or `peer` entry:

    <pre>maxpoll <sub idref="var_time_service_set_maxpoll" /></pre>

    to <pre>server</pre> directives. If using chrony any <pre>pool</pre> directives

    should be configured too.

    If no <tt>server</tt> or <tt>pool</tt> directives are configured, the rule evaluates

    to pass.'
rationale: 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
    can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
    event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating
    system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may
    be inaccurate.

    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps
    for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over
    a network.

    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the
    authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).'

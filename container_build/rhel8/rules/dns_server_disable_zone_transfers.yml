description: "Is it necessary for a secondary nameserver to receive zone data\nvia\
    \ zone transfer from the primary server?  If not, follow the instructions in\n\
    this section. If so, see the next section for instructions on protecting zone\n\
    transfers.\nAdd or correct the following directive within <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>:\n\
    <pre>options {\n  allow-transfer { none; };\n  ...\n}</pre>"
rationale: 'If both the primary and secondary nameserver are under your control,

    or if you have only one nameserver, it may be possible to use an external

    configuration management mechanism to distribute zone updates. In that case, it

    is not necessary to allow zone transfers within BIND itself, so they should be

    disabled to avoid the potential for abuse.'

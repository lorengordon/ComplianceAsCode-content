description: 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems providing tools to interface with
    audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user
    accessing the tools, and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access
    decisions regarding the access to audit tools.


    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit
    tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity
    and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.


    Audit tools must have a mode of 0755 or less permissive.'
rationale: 'Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting
    the tools used to view and manipulate log data.

    Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operations
    on audit information.'

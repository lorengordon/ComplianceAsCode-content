description: 'The SGID (set group id) bit should be set only on files that were

    installed via authorized means. A straightforward means of identifying

    unauthorized SGID files is determine if any were not installed as part of an

    RPM package, which is cryptographically verified. Investigate the origin

    of any unpackaged SGID files.

    This configuration check considers authorized SGID files which were installed
    via RPM.

    It is assumed that when an individual has sudo access to install an RPM

    and all packages are signed with an organizationally-recognized GPG key,

    the software should be considered an approved package on the system.

    Any SGID file not deployed through an RPM will be flagged for further review.'
rationale: 'Executable files with the SGID permission run with the privileges of

    the owner of the file. SGID files of uncertain provenance could allow for

    unprivileged users to elevate privileges. The presence of these files should be

    strictly controlled on the system.'

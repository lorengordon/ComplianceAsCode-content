description: 'By default, the anonymous FTP root is the home directory of the FTP
    user account. The df command can

    be used to verify that this directory is on its own partition.'
rationale: 'If there is a mission-critical reason for anonymous users to upload files,
    precautions must be taken to prevent

    these users from filling a disk used by other services.'

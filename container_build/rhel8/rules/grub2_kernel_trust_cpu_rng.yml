description: 'There exist two ways how to ensure that the Linux kernel trusts the
    CPU

    hardware random number generator. If the option is configured during kernel

    compilation, e.g. the option <tt>CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU</tt> is set to

    <tt>Y</tt>, make sure that it is not overridden with the boot parameter.

    There must not exist the boot parameter <tt>random.trust_cpu=off</tt>. If

    the option is not compiled in, make sure that <tt>random.trust_cpu=on</tt>

    is configured as a boot parameter.

    To ensure that <tt>random.trust_cpu=on</tt> is added as a kernel command line

    argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>random.trust_cpu=on</tt> to the

    default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:

    <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... random.trust_cpu=on ..."</pre>

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre>#
    grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="random.trust_cpu=on"</pre>'
rationale: 'The Linux kernel offers an option which signifies if the kernel should
    trust

    data provided by CPU hardware random number generator. Hardware random

    number generators can provide random data very quickly and are used to generate
    random cryptographic keys. They can

    be useful during boot time when other means of getting random data can be

    slow because there is not yet enough entropy in the system.'

ocil_clause: the kernel is not configured to trust the CPU RNG
ocil: 'Make sure that the kernel is configured to trust the CPU RNG by following

    commands. To check if the option was correctly configured at kernel compile

    time, run the following command:

    <pre>grep -q CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>

    If the command outputs:

    <pre>CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y</pre>,

    it means that the option is compiled into the kernel. Make sure that the

    option is not overridden through a boot parameter:

    <pre>sudo grep ''kernelopts.*random\.trust_cpu=off.*'' /boot/grub2/grubenv</pre>

    The command should not return any output. If the option is not compiled into

    the kernel, check that the option is configured through boot parameter.

    Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system

    in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. If it includes <tt>random.trust_cpu=on</tt>,

    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.

    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*random.trust_cpu=on.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*random.trust_cpu=on.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>.Moreover,
    command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.

    Run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v ''random.trust_cpu=on''</pre>

    The command should not return any output.'

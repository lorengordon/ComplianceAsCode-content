description: 'Configure a login banner for each website when authentication is required
    for

    user access.'
rationale: 'A consent banner will be in place to make prospective entrants aware that
    the

    website they are about to enter is a DoD web site and their activity is subject

    to monitoring. The document, DoDI 8500.01, establishes the policy on the use of

    DoD information systems. It requires the use of a standard Notice and Consent

    Banner and standard text to be included in user agreements. The requirement for

    the banner is for websites with security and access controls. These are

    restricted and not publicly accessible. If the website does not require

    authentication/authorization for use, then the banner does not need to be

    present. A manual check of the document root directory for a banner page file

    (such as banner.html) or navigation to the website via a browser can be used to

    confirm the information provided from interviewing the web staff.'

    By default, <tt>iptables</tt>

    blocks access to the ports used by the web server.

    To configure <tt>iptables</tt> to allow port 80 traffic, one must edit

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use).

    Add the following line, ensuring that it appears before the final LOG and DROP
    lines for the INPUT chain:

    <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT</pre>

    To configure <tt>iptables</tt> to allow port 443 traffic, one must edit

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use).

    Add the following line, ensuring that it appears before the final LOG and DROP
    lines for the INPUT chain:

    <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</pre>'
rationale: 'Failure to comply with DoD ports, protocols, and services (PPS) requirements

    can result in compromise of enclave boundary protections and/or functionality

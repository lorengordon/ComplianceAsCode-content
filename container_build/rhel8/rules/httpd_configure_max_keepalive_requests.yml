description: 'The <tt>MaxKeepAliveRequests</tt> directive should be set and configured
    to

    <sub idref="var_max_keepalive_requests" /> or greater by setting the following

    in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:

    <pre>MaxKeepAliveRequests <sub idref="var_max_keepalive_requests" /></pre>'
rationale: 'Resource exhaustion can occur when an unlimited number of concurrent requests

    are allowed on a web site, facilitating a denial of service attack. Mitigating

    this kind of attack will include limiting the number of concurrent HTTP/HTTPS

    requests per IP address and may include, where feasible, limiting parameter

    values associated with keepalive, (i.e., a parameter used to limit the amount
    of

    time a connection may be inactive).'

    The command should return the following:

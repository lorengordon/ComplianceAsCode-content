description: 'Disable old SSL and TLS version and enable the latest TLS encryption
    by setting

    the following in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ssl.conf</tt>:

    <pre>SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1</pre>

    Make sure to also set <tt>SSLEngine</tt> to <tt>on</tt> in

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ssl.conf</tt> like the following:

    <pre>SSLEngine on</pre>'
rationale: 'Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting
    for a

    private web server. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring

    data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be

    intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. A web server must

    use a FIPS 140-2 approved TLS version, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL versions

    must be disabled.'

description: 'Use only secure encrypted logons and connections for uploading files
    to the web

    site.'

    upload

    documents to the web site, is a risk if proper encryption is not utilized to

    protect the data being transmitted. An encrypted protocol or service must be

    used for remote access to web administration tasks.'

description: 'The <tt>mod_rewrite</tt> module is very powerful and can protect against

    certain classes of web attacks. However, it is also very complex and has a

    significant history of vulnerabilities itself. If its functionality is

    unnecessary, comment out the related module:

    <pre>#LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so</pre>'
rationale: 'Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
    reduces risk

    by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.'

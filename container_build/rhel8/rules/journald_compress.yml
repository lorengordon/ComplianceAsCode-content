description: The journald system can compress large log files to avoid fill the system
    disk.
rationale: Log files that are not properly compressed run the risk of growing so large
    that they fill up the log partition. Valuable logging information could be lost
    if the log partition becomes full.

    Run the following command to verify that journald is compressing logs.

    <pre>

    grep "^\sCompress" /etc/systemd/journald.conf

    </pre>

    and it should return

    <pre>

    Compress=yes

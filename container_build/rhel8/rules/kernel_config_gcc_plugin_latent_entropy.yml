description: "Instrument some kernel code to extract some entropy from both original\
    \ and artificially created\nprogram state. This will help especially embedded\
    \ systems where there is little 'natural' source\nof entropy normally.\n\nThis\
    \ configuration is available from kernel 4.9, but may be available if backported\n\
    by distros.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at\
    \ <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'This helps generate entropy during startup and is particularly relevant
    for devices with

    inappropriate entropy sources.'

warnings:
-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.
-   general: Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically secure!
-   performance: There is a performance cost during the boot process (about 0.5%)
        and fork and irq processing.

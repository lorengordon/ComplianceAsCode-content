description: "Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually called\
    \ \"hibernation\" in user\ninterfaces. STD checkpoints the system and powers it\
    \ off; and restores that checkpoint on\nreboot.\n\nThe configuration that was\
    \ used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check\
    \ the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_HIBERNATION</tt>, run the following command:\n\
    \    <tt>grep CONFIG_HIBERNATION /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs with value\
    \ 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either commented lines or no\n  \
    \  lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: Suspending to disk allows one to replace the running kernel.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

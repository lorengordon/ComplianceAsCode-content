description: 'The <code>iptables-services</code> package can be installed with the
    following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum install iptables-services</pre>'
rationale: '<tt>iptables-services</tt> provides the services iptables and ip6tables
    that have been split

    out of the base package since they are not active by default anymore.

    These services load the iptables rules during the system startup and also allow
    one to reload

    the iptables rules during runtime.'

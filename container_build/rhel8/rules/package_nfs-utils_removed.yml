description: 'The <code>nfs-utils</code> package can be removed with the following

rationale: '<tt>nfs-utils</tt> provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and related
    tools. This

    package also contains the <tt>showmount</tt> program. <tt>showmount</tt> queries
    the mount

    daemon on a remote host for information about the Network File System (NFS) server
    on the

    remote host. For example, <tt>showmount</tt> can display the clients which are
    mounted on

    that host.'

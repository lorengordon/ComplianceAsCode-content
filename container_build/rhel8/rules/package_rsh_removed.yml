description: '

    The <tt>rsh</tt> package contains the client commands


    for the rsh services'
rationale: 'These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have

    been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed,

    it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from

    inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing


    their credentials. Note that removing the <tt>rsh</tt> package removes


    the clients for <tt>rsh</tt>,<tt>rcp</tt>, and <tt>rlogin</tt>.'

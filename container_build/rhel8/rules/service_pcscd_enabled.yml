description: '

    The <code>pcscd</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable pcscd.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
    from

    the information system, ensures that even if the information system is

    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the

    authentication device.

    <br /><br />

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from

    information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens

    providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such

    as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common

    Access Card.'

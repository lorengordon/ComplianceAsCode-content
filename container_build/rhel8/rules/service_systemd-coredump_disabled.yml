description: 'The <tt>systemd-coredump.socket</tt> unit is a socket activation of

    the <tt>systemd-coredump@.service</tt> which processes core dumps.

    By masking the unit, core dump processing is disabled.'
rationale: 'A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system

    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data

    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.'

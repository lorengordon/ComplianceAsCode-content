description: 'To set up SSH client to use entropy from a high-quality source, make
    sure

    that the appropriate shell environment variable is configured. The

    <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> environment variable determines how many bytes

    of entropy to use. Make sure that the file

    <tt>/etc/profile.d/cc-ssh-strong-rng.sh</tt> contains line

    <pre>export SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>.'
rationale: 'Some SSH implementations use the openssl library for entropy, which by
    default, doesn''t use high-entropy sources.

    Randomness is needed to generate considerably more secure data-encryption keys.
    Plaintext padding, initialization vectors

    in encryption algorithms, and high-quality entropy eliminates the possibility
    that the output of

    the random number generator used by SSH would be known to potential attackers.'

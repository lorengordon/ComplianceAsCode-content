description: The sudo <tt>NOPASSWD</tt> tag, when specified, allows a user to execute
    commands using sudo without having to authenticate. Only the <tt>vdsm</tt> user
    should have this capability in any sudo configuration snippets in <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt>.
rationale: 'Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks
    for which they

    do not have authorization.

    <br /><br />

    When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability,
    it

    is critical that the user re-authenticate.'

    sudo,

    run the following command:

    The command should return output only for the vdsm user.'

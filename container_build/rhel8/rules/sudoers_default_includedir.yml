description: 'Administrators can configure authorized <tt>sudo</tt> users via drop-in
    files, and it is possible to include

    other directories and configuration files from the file currently being parsed.


    Make sure that <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> only includes drop-in configuration files
    from <tt>/etc/sudoers.d</tt>,

    or that no drop-in file is included.

    Either the <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> should contain only one <tt>#includedir</tt>
    directive pointing to

    <tt>/etc/sudoers.d</tt>, and no file in <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> should include
    other files or directories;

    Or the <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> should not contain any <tt>#include</tt>,

    <tt>@include</tt>, <tt>#includedir</tt> or <tt>@includedir</tt> directives.

    Note that the ''#'' character doesn''t denote a comment in the configuration file.'
rationale: 'Some <tt>sudo</tt> configurtion options allow users to run programs without
    re-authenticating.

    Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised accound
    to be used to

    compromise other accounts.'

ocil: 'To determine whether <tt>sudo</tt> command includes configuration files from
    the appropriate directory,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -rP ''^[#@]include(dir)?'' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d</pre>

    If only the line <tt>/etc/sudoers:#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</tt> is returned,
    then the drop-in include configuration is set correctly.

    Any other line returned is a finding.'

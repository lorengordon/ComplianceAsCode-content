description: 'The web server is responsible for providing access to

    content via the HTTP protocol. Web servers represent a significant

    security risk because:

    <br /><br />

    <ul>

    <li>The HTTP port is commonly probed by malicious sources</li>

    <li>Web server software is very complex, and includes a long

    history of vulnerabilities</li>

    <li>The HTTP protocol is unencrypted and vulnerable to passive

    monitoring</li>

    </ul>

    <br /><br />

    The system''s default web server software is Apache 2 and is

    provided in the RPM package <tt>httpd</tt>.'

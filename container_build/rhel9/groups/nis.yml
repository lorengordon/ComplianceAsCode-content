description: 'The Network Information Service (NIS), also known as ''Yellow

    Pages'' (YP), and its successor NIS+ have been made obsolete by

    Kerberos, LDAP, and other modern centralized authentication

    services. NIS should not be used because it suffers from security

    problems inherent in its design, such as inadequate protection of

    important authentication information.'

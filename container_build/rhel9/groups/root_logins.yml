description: 'Direct root logins should be allowed only for emergency use.

    In normal situations, the administrator should access the system

    via a unique unprivileged account, and then use <tt>su</tt> or <tt>sudo</tt> to
    execute

    privileged commands. Discouraging administrators from accessing the

    root account directly ensures an audit trail in organizations with

    multiple administrators. Locking down the channels through which

    root can connect directly also reduces opportunities for

    password-guessing against the root account. The <tt>login</tt> program

    uses the file <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> to determine which interfaces

    should allow root logins.


    The virtual devices <tt>/dev/console</tt>

    and <tt>/dev/tty*</tt> represent the system consoles (accessible via

    the Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F6 keyboard sequences on a default

    installation). The default securetty file also contains <tt>/dev/vc/*</tt>.

    These are likely to be deprecated in most environments, but may be retained

    for compatibility. Root should also be prohibited from connecting

    via network protocols. Other sections of this document

    include guidance describing how to prevent root from logging in via SSH.'

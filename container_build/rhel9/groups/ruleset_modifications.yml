description: 'The default rules can be strengthened. The system

    scripts that activate the firewall rules expect them to be defined

    in configuration files under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>

    and <tt>/etc/firewalld/zones</tt> directories.

    <br /><br />

    The following recommendations describe how to strengthen the

    default ruleset configuration file. An alternative to editing this

    configuration file is to create a shell script that makes calls to

    the <tt>firewall-cmd</tt> program to load in rules under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>

    and <tt>/etc/firewalld/zones</tt> directories.

    <br /><br />

    Instructions apply to both unless otherwise noted. Language and address

    conventions for regular firewalld rules are used throughout this section.'
warnings:
-   general: 'The program <tt>firewall-config</tt>

        allows additional services to penetrate the default firewall rules

        and automatically adjusts the <tt>firewalld</tt> ruleset(s).'

description: 'This rule configures the system to lock out the <tt>root</tt> account
    after a number of

    incorrect login attempts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>.


    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must
    be carefully

    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid errors when manually editing these
    files, it is

    recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,

    depending on the OS version.'
rationale: 'By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized
    system access via

    user password guessing, also known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed
    by locking

    the account.'

description: 'Set the mode on files being executed by the user initialization files
    with the

    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod o-w <i>FILE</i></pre>'
rationale: 'If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in

    unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user

    files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is

    compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually

    compromise the system at the root and network level.'

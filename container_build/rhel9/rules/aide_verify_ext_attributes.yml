description: 'By default, the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is added to the <tt>FIPSR</tt>
    ruleset in AIDE.

    If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is missing, add <tt>xattrs</tt>

    to the appropriate ruleset.

    For example, add <tt>xattrs</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:

    <pre>FIPSR = p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+acl+selinux+xattrs+sha256</pre>

    AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that
    is already

    configured by default.


    The remediation provided with this rule adds <tt>xattrs</tt> to all rule sets
    available in

    <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>'
rationale: 'Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data
    and file metadata

    with security implications.'

description: 'Ensure that successful attempts to delete a file are audited.


    The following rules configure audit as described above:

    <pre>## Successful file delete

    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F success=1 -F
    auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-delete    </pre>


    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:

    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>


    Note: This rule uses a special set of Audit rules to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You
    may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended
    that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned
    with your needs.'
rationale: Auditing of successful attempts to delete a file may help in monitoring
    and investigation of activities performed on the system.

description: 'To enable console screen locking in <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer,

    the <tt>vlock</tt> command must be configured to be used as a locking

    mechanism.

    Add the following line to <tt>/etc/tmux.conf</tt>:

    <pre>set -g lock-command vlock</pre>.

    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:

    However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The <tt>tmux</tt>

            work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
            system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of
            the absence.


            The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can
            be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire
            before the user session can be locked, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 must
            provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users
            can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the
            immediate physical vicinity.


            The "tmux" package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
            However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The "tmux"

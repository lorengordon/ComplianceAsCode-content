description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
    usage of many packages.

    OpenSSH is supported by system crypto policy, but the OpenSSH configuration may
    be

    set up incorrectly.


    To check that Crypto Policies settings for ciphers are configured correctly, ensure
    that

    <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</tt> contains the following

    line and is not commented out:

    <pre>Ciphers <sub idref="sshd_approved_ciphers" /></pre>'
rationale: "Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the OpenSSH\
    \ client\nviolate expectations, and makes system configuration more fragmented.\
    \ By\nspecifying a cipher list with the order of ciphers being in a \u201Cstrongest\
    \ to\nweakest\u201D orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use\
    \ the\nstrongest cipher for securing SSH connections."

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

        vuldiscussion: 'Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can
            be altered by unauthorized users without detection.


            Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems
            by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through
            an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods
            include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.


            Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information
            include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
            enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information
            while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate
            the hash.

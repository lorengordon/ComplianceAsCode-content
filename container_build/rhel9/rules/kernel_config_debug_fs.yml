description: "<tt>debugfs</tt> is a virtual file system that kernel developers use\
    \ to put debugging files\ninto. Enable this option to be able to read and write\
    \ to these files.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available\
    \ at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_DEBUG_FS</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_DEBUG_FS /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: To reduce the attack surface, this file system should be disabled if not
    in use.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

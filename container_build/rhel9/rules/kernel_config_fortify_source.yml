description: "Detect overflows of buffers in common string and memory functions where\
    \ the compiler can\ndetermine and validate the buffer sizes.\nThis configuration\
    \ is available from kernel 4.13, but may be available if backported by distros.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE</tt>, run\
    \ the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This features helps reduce likelihood of memory corruption of kernel structures.

warnings:
-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

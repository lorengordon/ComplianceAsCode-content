description: "This option checks for obviously wrong memory regions when copying memory\
    \ to/from the kernel\n(via copy_to_user() and copy_from_user() functions) by rejecting\
    \ memory ranges that are larger\nthan the specified heap object, span multiple\
    \ separately allocated pages, are not on the\nprocess stack, or are part of the\
    \ kernel text.\nThis configuration is available from kernel 4.8, and may be available\
    \ if backported by distros.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel\
    \ is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value\
    \ for <tt>CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep\
    \ CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each kernel installed,\
    \ a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'This config prevents entire classes of heap overflow exploits and similar
    kernel memory exposures.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with

description: "Disable support for IP version 6 (IPv6).\n\nThe configuration that was\
    \ used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check\
    \ the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_IPV6</tt>, run the following command:\n\
    \    <tt>grep CONFIG_IPV6 /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    Configs with value 'n'\
    \ are not explicitly set in the file, so either commented lines or no\n    lines\
    \ should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'Any unnecessary network stacks, including IPv6, should be disabled to
    reduce

    the vulnerability to exploitation.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

description: "This feature reduces the number of hardware side channels by ensuring\
    \ that the majority of\nkernel addresses are not mapped into userspace.\nThis\
    \ configuration is available from kernel 4.15, but may be available if backported\n\
    by distros.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at\
    \ <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: This is a countermeasure to the Meltdown attack.

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.

description: "Enabling this switches the refcounting infrastructure from a fast unchecked\
    \ atomic_t\nimplementation to a fully state checked implementation, which can\
    \ have a slight\nimpact in performance.\nThis configuration is available from\
    \ kernel 4.13, but may be available if backported\nby distros.\n\nThe configuration\
    \ that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n   \
    \ To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL</tt>, run the\
    \ following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'Refcounting provides protections against various use-after-free conditions
    that can be

    used in security flaw exploits.'

description: "This option checks for a stack overrun on calls to schedule(). If the\
    \ stack end location is\nfound to be overwritten always panic as the content of\
    \ the corrupted region can no longer\nbe trusted.\nThis configuration is available\
    \ from kernel 3.18.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available\
    \ at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK</tt>,\
    \ run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    For each kernel installed, a line with value \"y\" should be returned.\n\
    \    "
rationale: 'This ensures no erroneous behaviour occurs which could result in data
    corruption or a

    sporadic crash at a later stage once the region is examined.'

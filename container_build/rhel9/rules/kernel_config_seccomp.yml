description: "This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications that\
    \ may need to compute\nuntrusted bytecode during their execution. By using pipes\
    \ or other transports made available\nto the process as file descriptors supporting\
    \ the read/write syscalls, it's possible to isolate\nthose applications in their\
    \ own address space using seccomp.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build\
    \ kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration\
    \ value for <tt>CONFIG_SECCOMP</tt>, run the following command:\n    <tt>grep\
    \ CONFIG_SECCOMP /boot/config-*</tt>\n    \n    For each kernel installed, a line\
    \ with value \"y\" should be returned.\n    "
rationale: '<tt>seccomp</tt> enables the ability to filter system calls made by an
    application, effectively

    isolating the system''s resources from it.'

description: 'If a file server (FTP, TFTP...) is hosted locally, create a separate
    partition

    for <tt>/srv</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If

    <tt>/srv</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then

    creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the

    mountpoint can instead be configured later.'
rationale: 'Srv deserves files for local network file server such as FTP. Ensuring

    that <tt>/srv</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of

    more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that

    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.'

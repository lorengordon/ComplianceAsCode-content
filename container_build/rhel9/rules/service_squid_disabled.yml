description: '

    The <code>squid</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now squid.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Running proxy server software provides a network-based avenue

    of attack, and should be removed if not needed.'
severity: unknown

identifiers:
    cce: CCE-84239-3
ocil_clause: the "squid" is loaded and not masked
ocil: 'To check that the <code>squid</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>squid</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>squid</code> service has either not been installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>squid</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>squid</code> is not active (i.e. not
    running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active squid</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>squid</code> is masked,
    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>squid</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'

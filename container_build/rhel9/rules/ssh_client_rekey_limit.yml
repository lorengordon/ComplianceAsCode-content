description: 'The <tt>RekeyLimit</tt> parameter specifies how often

    the session key is renegotiated, both in terms of

    amount of data that may be transmitted and the time

    elapsed. To decrease the default limits, put line

    <tt>RekeyLimit <sub idref="var_ssh_client_rekey_limit_size" /> <sub idref="var_ssh_client_rekey_limit_time"
    /></tt> to file <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/02-rekey-limit.conf</tt>.

    Make sure that there is no other <tt>RekeyLimit</tt> configuration preceding

    the <tt>include</tt> directive in the main config file

    <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt>. Check also other files in

    <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d</tt> directory. Files are processed according to

    lexicographical order of file names. Make sure that there is no file

    processed before <tt>02-rekey-limit.conf</tt> containing definition of

    <tt>RekeyLimit</tt>.'
rationale: 'By decreasing the limit based on the amount of data and enabling

    time-based limit, effects of potential attacks against

    encryption keys are limited.'

        vuldiscussion: 'Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality
            and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can
            be intercepted and either read or altered.


            This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all
            types of information system components from which information can be transmitted
            (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers,
            scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical
            protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
            interception and modification.


            Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information
            can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution
            systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques).
            If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography)
            do not have to be employed, and vice versa.


            Session key regeneration limits the chances of a session key becoming
            compromised.'

description: 'When creating SSH key pairs, always use a passcode.

    <br />

    You can create such keys with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo ssh-keygen -n [passphrase]</pre>

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, for certificate-based authentication, must enforce
    authorized access to the corresponding private key.'
rationale: 'If an unauthorized user obtains access to a private key without a passcode,

    that user would have unauthorized access to any system where the associated

    public key has been installed.'

        vuldiscussion: 'If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the
            key to authenticate as an authorized user and gain access to the network
            infrastructure.


            The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally
            sign information.


            If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the
            authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker
            can use the private key to digitally sign documents and pretend to be
            the authorized user.


            Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must
            protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the
            private keys.'

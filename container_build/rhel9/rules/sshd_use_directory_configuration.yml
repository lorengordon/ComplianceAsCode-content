description: 'Make sure to have the <tt>Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf</tt>
    line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file.

    Ideally, don''t have any active configuration directives in that file, and distribute
    the service configuration

    to several files in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</tt> directory.'
rationale: 'This form of distributed configuration is considered as a good practice,
    and as other sshd rules assume that directives in files in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</tt>
    config directory are effective, there has to be a rule that ensures this.

    Aside from that, having multiple configuration files makes the SSH Server configuration
    changes easier to partition according to the reason that they were introduced,
    and therefore it should help to perform merges of hardening updates.'

ocil_clause: you don't include other configuration files from the main configuration
    file
ocil: 'To determine whether the SSH server includes configuration files from the right
    directory, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -i ''^Include'' /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

    If a line <tt>Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf</tt> is returned, then the
    configuration file inclusion is set correctly.'

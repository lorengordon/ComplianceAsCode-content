description: 'Policies applied by sudo through the sudoers file should not involve
    negation.


    Each user specification in the <code>sudoers</code> file contains a comma-delimited
    list of command specifications.

    The definition can make use glob patterns, as well as of negations.

    Indirect definition of those commands by means of exclusion of a set of commands
    is trivial to bypass, so it is not allowed to use such constructs.'
rationale: "Specifying access right using negation is inefficient and can be easily\
    \ circumvented.\nFor example, it is expected that a specification like <pre>\n\
    # To avoid absolutely , this rule can be easily circumvented!\nuser ALL = ALL\
    \ ,!/ bin/sh\n</pre> prevents the execution of the shell\nbut that\u2019s not\
    \ the case: just copy the binary <code>/bin/sh</code> to a different name to make\
    \ it executable\nagain through the rule keyword <code>ALL</code>."

ocil_clause: /etc/sudoers file contains rules that define the set of allowed commands
    using negation
ocil: 'To determine if negation is used to define commands users are allowed to execute
    using <tt>sudo</tt>, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR ''^(?:\s*[^#=]+)=(?:\s*(?:\([^\)]+\))?\s*(?!\s*\()[^,!\n][^,\n]+,)*\s*(?:\([^\)]+\))?\s*(?!\s*\()(!\S+).*''
    /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>

    The command should return no output.'

warnings:
-   general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, as negations indicate design
        issues with the sudoers user specifications design. Just removing negations
        doesn't increase the security - you typically have to rethink the definition
        of allowed commands to fix the issue.

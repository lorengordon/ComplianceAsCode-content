description: 'The targeted users of a user specification should be, as much as possible,
    non privileged users (i.e.: non-root).


    User specifications have to explicitly list the runas spec (i.e. the list of target
    users that can be impersonated), and <tt>ALL</tt> or <tt>root</tt> should not
    be used.'
rationale: 'It is common that the command to be executed does not require superuser
    rights (editing a file

    whose the owner is not root, sending a signal to an unprivileged process,etc.).
    In order to limit

    any attempt of privilege escalation through a command, it is better to apply normal
    user rights.'

ocil_clause: /etc/sudoers file contains rules that allow non-root users to run commands
    as root
ocil: 'To determine if the users are allowed to run commands as root, run the following
    commands:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR ''^\s*((?!root\b)[\w]+)\s*(\w+)\s*=\s*(.*,)?\s*[^\(\s]''
    /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>

    and

    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR ''^\s*((?!root\b)[\w]+)\s*(\w+)\s*=\s*(.*,)?\s*\([\w\s]*\b(root|ALL)\b[\w\s]*\)''
    /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>

    Both commands should return no output.'

warnings:
-   general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, as the exact requirement allows
        exceptions, and removing lines from the sudoers file can make the system non-administrable.

description: 'The <tt>kernel.core_pattern</tt> option specifies the core dumpfile
    pattern

    name. It can be set to an empty string. In this case, the kernel

    behaves differently based on another related option. If

    <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt>, then a file named as

    <tt>.PID</tt> (where <tt>PID</tt> is process ID of the crashed process) is

    created in the working directory. If <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to

    <tt>0</tt>, no coredump is saved.

    To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.core_pattern</code> kernel parameter,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=</pre>


    To make sure that the setting is persistent,

    add the following line to a file in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>:

    <pre>kernel.core_pattern = </pre>'
rationale: 'A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system

    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is
    generally useful

    only for developers trying to debug problems.'

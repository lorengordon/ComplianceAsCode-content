description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>user.max_user_namespaces</code>
    kernel parameter,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w user.max_user_namespaces=0</pre>


    To make sure that the setting is persistent,

    add the following line to a file in the directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>:

    <pre>user.max_user_namespaces = 0</pre>

    When containers are deployed on the machine, the value should be set

    to large non-zero value.'
rationale: 'It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
    functionality exceeding requirements or system objectives.

    These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore
    may remain unsecured.

    They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

    User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. The value 0

    disallows the use of user namespaces.'

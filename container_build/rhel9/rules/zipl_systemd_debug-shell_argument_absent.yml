description: 'systemd''s <tt>debug-shell</tt> service is intended to

    diagnose systemd related boot issues with various <tt>systemctl</tt>

    commands. Once enabled and following a system reboot, the root shell

    will be available on <tt>tty9</tt> which is access by pressing

    <tt>CTRL-ALT-F9</tt>. The <tt>debug-shell</tt> service should only be used

    for systemd related issues and should otherwise be disabled.

    <br /><br />

    By default, the <tt>debug-shell</tt> systemd service is already disabled.


    Ensure the debug-shell is not enabled by the <tt>systemd.debug-shel=1</tt>

    boot paramenter option.


    Check that not boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have

    <tt>systemd.debug-shell=1</tt> included in its options.<br />

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries don''t enable the debug-shell, check

    that <tt>systemd.debug-shell=1</tt> is not present in <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.'
rationale: 'This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
    security

    on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root

    access when the system is rebooted.'

    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that enables the
    debug-shell.'

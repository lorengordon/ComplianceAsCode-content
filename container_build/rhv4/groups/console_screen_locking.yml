description: 'A console screen locking mechanism is a temporary action taken when
    a user

    stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the

    information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of

    the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their

    operation system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems

    need to be able to identify when a user''s session has idled and take action

    to initiate the session lock.'

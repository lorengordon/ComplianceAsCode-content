description: 'Despite configuration that suggests support for IPv6 has

    been disabled, link-local IPv6 address auto-configuration occurs

    even when only an IPv4 address is assigned. The only way to

    effectively prevent execution of the IPv6 networking stack is to

    instruct the system not to activate the IPv6 kernel module.'

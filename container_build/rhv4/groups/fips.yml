description: "The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a computer security\
    \ standard which\nis developed by the U.S. Government and industry working groups\
    \ to validate the quality\nof cryptographic modules. The FIPS standard provides\
    \ four security levels to ensure\nadequate coverage of different industries, implementation\
    \ of cryptographic modules, and\norganizational sizes and requirements.\n<br /><br\
    \ />\nFIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to\
    \ access cryptographic modules\nutilize authentication that meets industry and\
    \ government requirements. For government systems, this allows\nSecurity Levels\
    \ 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on Red Hat Virtualization 4.\n<br /><br />\nSee <b>\n\

description: 'Most systems must be connected to a network of some

    sort, and this brings with it the substantial risk of network

    attack. This section discusses the security impact of decisions

    about networking which must be made when configuring a system.

    <br /><br />

    This section also discusses firewalls, network access

    controls, and other network security frameworks, which allow

    system-level rules to be written that can limit an attackers'' ability

    to connect to your system. These rules can specify that network

    traffic should be allowed or denied from certain IP addresses,

    hosts, and networks. The rules can also specify which of the

    system''s network services are available to particular hosts or

    networks.'

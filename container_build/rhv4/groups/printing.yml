description: "The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) service provides both local\n\
    and network printing support. A system running the CUPS service can accept\nprint\
    \ jobs from other systems, process them, and send them to the appropriate\nprinter.\
    \ It also provides an interface for remote administration through a web\nbrowser.\
    \ The CUPS service is installed and activated by default. The project\nhomepage\
    \ and more detailed documentation are available at\n\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\

description: 'To configure the number of retry prompts that are permitted per-session:


    Edit the <tt>pam_pwquality.so</tt> statement in


    <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> to show



    <tt>retry=<sub idref="var_password_pam_retry" /></tt>, or a lower value if site

    policy is more restrictive. The DoD requirement is a maximum of 3 prompts

    per session.'
rationale: 'Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session
    basis to a low value

    requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and

    draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks. Note that
    this

    is different from account lockout, which is provided by the pam_faillock module.'

            required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
            is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
            at guessing and brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password
            construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks
            on the system.


            Red Hat Virtualization 4 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password

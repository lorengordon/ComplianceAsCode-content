description: 'Change the group of a local interactive users files and directories
    to a

    group that the interactive user is a member of. To change the group owner of a

    local interactive users files and directories, use the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i>/<i>FILE_DIR</i></pre>


    This rule ensures every file or directory under the home directory related

    to an interactive user is group-owned by an interactive user.'
rationale: 'If a local interactive users files are group-owned by a group of which
    the

    user is not a member, unintended users may be able to access them.'

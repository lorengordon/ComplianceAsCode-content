description: 'Change the owner of interactive users home directories to that correct

    owner. To change the owner of a interactive users home directory, use

    the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chown <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>


    This rule ensures every home directory related to an interactive user is

    owned by an interactive user. It also ensures that interactive users are

    owners of one and only one home directory.'
rationale: 'If a local interactive user does not own their home directory, unauthorized

    users could access or modify the user''s files, and the users may not be able
    to

    access their own files.'

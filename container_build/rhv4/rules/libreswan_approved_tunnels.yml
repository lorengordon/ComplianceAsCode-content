description: 'Libreswan provides an implementation of IPsec

    and IKE, which permits the creation of secure tunnels over

    untrusted networks. As such, IPsec can be used to circumvent certain

    network requirements such as filtering. Verify that if any IPsec connection

    (<tt>conn</tt>) configured in <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/ipsec.d</tt>

    exists is an approved organizational connection.'
rationale: IP tunneling mechanisms can be used to bypass network filtering.

description: 'To disable password-based root logins over SSH, add or correct the following
    line in



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password</pre>'
rationale: 'Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional

    layer of security is gained by preventing use of a password.

    This also helps to minimize direct attack attempts on root''s password.'

warnings:
-   general: 'While this disables password-based root logins, direct root logins

        through other means such as through SSH keys or GSSAPI will still be

        permitted. Permitting any sort of root login remotely opens up the

        root account to attack.

        To fully disable direct root logins over SSH (which is considered a

        best practice) and prevent remote attacks against the root account,

        see CCE-27100-7, CCE-27445-6, CCE-80901-2, and similar.'

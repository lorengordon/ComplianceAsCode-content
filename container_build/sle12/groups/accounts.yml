description: 'In traditional Unix security, if an attacker gains

    shell access to a certain login account, they can perform any action

    or access any file to which that account has access. Therefore,

    making it more difficult for unauthorized people to gain shell

    access to accounts, particularly to privileged accounts, is a

    necessary part of securing a system. This section introduces

    mechanisms for restricting access to accounts under

    SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.'

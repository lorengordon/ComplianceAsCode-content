description: "Many security vulnerabilities result from bugs in trusted programs.\
    \ A trusted\nprogram runs with privileges that attackers want to possess. The\
    \ program fails\nto keep that trust if there is a bug in the program that allows\
    \ the attacker to\nacquire said privilege.\n<br /><br />\nAppArmor\xAE is an application\
    \ security solution designed specifically to apply\nprivilege confinement to suspect\
    \ programs. AppArmor allows the administrator to\nspecify the domain of activities\
    \ the program can perform by developing a\nsecurity profile. A security profile\
    \ is a listing of files that the program may\naccess and the operations the program\
    \ may perform. AppArmor secures\napplications by enforcing good application behavior\
    \ without relying on attack\nsignatures, so it can prevent attacks even if previously\
    \ unknown\nvulnerabilities are being exploited.\n\n<br /><br />\nFor more information\
    \ on using AppArmor, see\n\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_security/data/cha_apparmor_intro.html'>https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_security/data/cha_apparmor_intro.html</a>."

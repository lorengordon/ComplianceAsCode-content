description: 'Configure the number or rounds for the password hashing algorithm. This
    can be

    accomplished by using the <tt>rounds</tt> option for the <tt>pam_unix</tt> PAM
    module.

    <br /><br />

    In file <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-password</tt> append <tt>rounds=<sub idref="var_password_pam_unix_rounds"

    to the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> entry, as shown below:

    <pre>password sufficient pam_unix.so <i>...existing_options...</i> rounds=<sub
    idref="var_password_pam_unix_rounds" /></pre>

    The system''s default number of rounds is 5000.'
rationale: Using a higher number of rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.

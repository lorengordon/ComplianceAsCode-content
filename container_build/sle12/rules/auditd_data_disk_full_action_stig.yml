description: 'The <tt>auditd</tt> service can be configured to take an action

    when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely.

    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line,

    substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:

    <pre>disk_full_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>

    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single-user

    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>syslog</tt>,

    <tt>single</tt>, and <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability

    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be

    determined. Details regarding all possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described
    in the

    <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man page.'
rationale: 'Taking appropriate action in case of a filled audit storage volume will
    minimize

    the possibility of losing audit records.'

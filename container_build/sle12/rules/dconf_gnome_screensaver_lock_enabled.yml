    To activate locking of the screensaver in the GNOME3 desktop when it is activated,

    run the following command to configure the SUSE operating system to allow the
    user to lock the GUI:

    <pre>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen false</pre>

    Validate that <tt>disable-lock-screen</tt> has been set to <tt>false</tt> with
    the command:

    <pre>gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen</pre>'
rationale: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
    moves away from the immediate physical vicinity

    of the information system but does not want to logout because of the temporary
    nature of the absense.'

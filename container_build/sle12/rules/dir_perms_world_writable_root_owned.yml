description: 'All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should
    be owned

    by root. If any world-writable directories are not owned by root, this

    should be investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or

    assigned to root user.'
rationale: 'Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is

    undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove

    or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other

    users.'

description: 'By default, DConf provides a standard user profile. This profile contains
    a list

    of DConf configuration databases. The user profile and database always take the

    highest priority. As such the DConf User profile should always exist and be

    configured correctly.

    <br /><br />


    To make sure that the user profile is configured correctly, the <tt>/etc/dconf/profile/gdm</tt>

    should be set as follows:

    <pre>user-db:user

    system-db:gdm

    </pre>'
rationale: 'Failure to have a functional DConf profile prevents GNOME3 configuration
    settings

    from being enforced for all users and allows various security risks.'

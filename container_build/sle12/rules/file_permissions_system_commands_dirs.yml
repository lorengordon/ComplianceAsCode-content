description: 'System commands are stored in the following directories by default:

    <pre>/bin

    /sbin

    /usr/bin

    /usr/sbin

    /usr/local/bin

    /usr/local/sbin</pre>

    All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable.

    If any file <i>FILE</i> in these directories is found

    to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the

    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chmod 755 <i>FILE</i></pre>'
rationale: 'System binaries are executed by privileged users, as well as system services,

    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure execution of these programs

    cannot be co-opted.'

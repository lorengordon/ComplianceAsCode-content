description: 'To enable processing of sensitive information the operating system must

    provide certified cryptographic modules compliant with FIPS 140-2

    standard.


    SUSE Enterprise Linux is supported by SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH. As
    the SUSE Enterprise

    Linux vendor, SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH is responsible for maintaining
    government

    certifications and standards.'
rationale: "The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2,\
    \ (FIPS\nPUB 140-2) is a computer security standard. The standard specifies security\n\
    requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive\nunclassified\
    \ information.  Refer to the full FIPS 140-2 standard at\n\n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\
    \ href='http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf'>http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf</a>\n\
    for further details on the requirements.\nFIPS 140-2 validation is required by\
    \ U.S. law when information systems use\ncryptography to protect sensitive government\
    \ information. In order to\nachieve FIPS 140-2 certification, cryptographic modules\
    \ are subject to\nextensive testing by independent laboratories, accredited by\
    \ National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."

-   general: There is no remediation besides switching to a different operating system.
-   regulatory: 'System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes

        FIPS-140 certifications.

        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use

        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information

        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as

        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform

        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in

        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal

        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under

        contract. See <b>

        <a xmlns=''http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'' href=''https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf''>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a></b>

        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by

        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing

        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third

        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is

        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor

        submits to this process.'

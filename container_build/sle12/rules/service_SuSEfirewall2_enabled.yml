    The <code>SuSEfirewall2</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable SuSEfirewall2.service</pre>'
rationale: 'To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of

    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types

    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or

    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.


    SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions

    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may

    not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.

    Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from

    a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk

    over limiting the services provided by any one component.'

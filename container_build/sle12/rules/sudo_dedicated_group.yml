description: 'Restrict the execution of privilege escalated commands to a dedicated
    group of users.

    Ensure the group owner of /usr/bin/sudo is <sub idref="var_sudo_dedicated_group"
    />.'
rationale: Restricting the set of users able to execute commands as privileged user
    reduces the attack surface.

ocil: 'To check the group ownership of <code>/usr/bin/sudo</code>,

    run the command:

    <pre>$ ls -lL /usr/bin/sudo</pre>

    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:

warnings:
-   functionality: 'Changing group owner of <tt>/usr/bin/sudo</tt> to a group with
        no member users will prevent

        any and all escalatation of privileges.

        Additionally, the system may become unmanageable if root logins are not allowed.'
-   general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, before remediating the sysadmin
        needs to add users to the dedicated sudo group.

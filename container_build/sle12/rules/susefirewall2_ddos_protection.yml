rationale: 'DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users.

    When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or

    must operate at degraded capacity.


    This requirement addresses the configuration of the SUSE operating system to

    mitigate the impact on system availability of DoS attacks that have occurred

    or are ongoing. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be

    identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of

    technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of

    DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions).

    Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service

    redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.'

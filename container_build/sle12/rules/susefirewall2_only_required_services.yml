description: 'The <code>SuSEfirewall2</code> package can be installed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo zypper install SuSEfirewall2</pre>


    The <code>SuSEfirewall2</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable SuSEfirewall2.service</pre>


    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited

    functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following

    command:


    <pre># grep ^FW_ /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2

    FW_SERVICES_ACCEPT_EXT="0/0,tcp,22,,hitcount=3,blockseconds=60,recentname=ssh"</pre>


    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM Component Local

    Services Assessment (Component Local Services Assessment (CLSA). Verify the

    services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA. '
rationale: 'To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of

    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types

    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or

    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.


    SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions

    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not

    be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally,

    it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single

    component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over

    limiting the services provided by any one component.


    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the SUSE

    operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing

    only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,

    and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct

    official business or address authorized quality-of-life issues.'

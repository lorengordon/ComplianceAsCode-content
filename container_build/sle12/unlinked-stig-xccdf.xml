      <title>The SUSE operating system file integrity tool must be configured to protect the integrity of the audit tools.</title>
      <description>Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,
and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
activity.

Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source
audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or
files.</description>
      <check system="C-217152_chk">
        <check-content>Check that AIDE is properly configured to protect the integrity of the

      <description>To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of
information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types

unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not
be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally,
it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single
component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over
limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the SUSE
operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing
only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,
and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct
official business or address authorized quality-of-life issues.</description>

that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
(public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.

Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
authentication device.

Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
Access Card.</description>

        <check-content>Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an
external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods
include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g.,
VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the
purpose of configuring the device itself (management).

Check that the pam_pkcs11.so option is configured in the
etc/pam.d/common-auth file with the following command:

# grep pam_pkcs11.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth

auth sufficient pam_pkcs11.so

If pam_pkcs11.so is not set in etc/pam.d/common-auth this
is a finding.
      Is it the case that non-exempt accounts are not using CAC authentication?

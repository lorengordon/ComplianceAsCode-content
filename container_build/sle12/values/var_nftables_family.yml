description: "Netfilter enables filtering at multiple networking levels. With iptables\
    \ there \nis a separate tool for each level: iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables.\
    \ \nWith nftables the multiple networking levels are abstracted into families,\
    \ \nall of which are served  by the single tool nft. \n<tt>ip</tt>Tables of this\
    \ family see IPv4 traffic/packets. \n<tt>ip6</tt>Tables of this family see IPv6\
    \ traffic/packets.\n<tt>inet</tt>Tables of this family see both IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ traffic/packets, \nsimplifying dual stack support. \n<tt>arp</tt>Tables of this\
    \ family see ARP-level (i.e, L2) traffic, before \nany L3 handling is done by\
    \ the kernel. \n<tt>bridge</tt>Tables of this family see traffic/packets traversing\
    \ bridges \n(i.e. switching). No assumptions are made about L3 protocols. \n<tt>netdev</tt>The\
    \ netdev family is different from the others in that it \nis used to create base\
    \ chains attached to a single network interface. Such \nbase chains see all network\
    \ traffic on the specified interface, with no \nassumptions about L2 or L3 protocols.\
    \ Therefore you can filter ARP traffic from here. "

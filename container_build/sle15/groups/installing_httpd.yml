description: 'If <tt>httpd</tt> was not installed and activated, but the system

    needs to act as a web server, then it should be installed on the system. Follow
    these

    guidelines to install it defensively. The <tt>httpd</tt> package can be installed
    with

    the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo yum install httpd</pre>

    This method of installation is recommended over installing the "Web Server"

    package group during the system installation process. The Web Server package

    group includes many packages which are likely extraneous, while the

    command-line method installs only the required <tt>httpd</tt> package itself.'

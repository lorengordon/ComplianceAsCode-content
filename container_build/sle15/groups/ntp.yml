description: "The Network Time Protocol is used to manage the system\nclock over a\
    \ network. Computer clocks are not very accurate, so\ntime will drift unpredictably\
    \ on unmanaged systems. Central time\nprotocols can be used both to ensure that\
    \ time is consistent among\na network of systems, and that their time is consistent\
    \ with the\noutside world.\n<br /><br />\nIf every system on a network reliably\
    \ reports the same time, then it is much\neasier to correlate log messages in\
    \ case of an attack. In addition, a number of\ncryptographic protocols (such as\
    \ Kerberos) use timestamps to prevent certain\ntypes of attacks. If your network\
    \ does not have synchronized time, these\nprotocols may be unreliable or even\
    \ unusable.\n<br /><br />\nDepending on the specifics of the network, global time\
    \ accuracy may be just as\nimportant as local synchronization, or not very important\
    \ at all. If your\nnetwork is connected to the Internet, using a public timeserver\
    \ (or one\nprovided by your enterprise) provides globally accurate timestamps\
    \ which may be\nessential in investigating or responding to an attack which originated\
    \ outside\nof your network.\n<br /><br />\nA typical network setup involves a\
    \ small number of internal systems operating\nas NTP servers, and the remainder\
    \ obtaining time information from those\ninternal servers.\n<br /><br />\nThere\
    \ is a choice between the daemons <tt>ntpd</tt> and <tt>chronyd</tt>, which\n\
    are available from the repositories in the <tt>ntp</tt> and <tt>chrony</tt>\n\
    packages respectively.\n<br /><br />\nThe default <tt>chronyd</tt> daemon can\
    \ work well when external time references\nare only intermittently accesible,\
    \ can perform well even when the network is\ncongested for longer periods of time,\
    \ can usually synchronize the clock faster\nand with better time accuracy, and\
    \ quickly adapts to sudden changes in the rate\nof the clock, for example, due\
    \ to changes in the temperature of the crystal\noscillator. <tt>Chronyd</tt> should\
    \ be considered for all systems which are\nfrequently suspended or otherwise intermittently\
    \ disconnected and reconnected\nto a network. Mobile and virtual systems for example.\n\
    <br /><br />\nThe <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemon fully supports NTP protocol version\
    \ 4 (RFC 5905),\nincluding broadcast, multicast, manycast clients and servers,\
    \ and the orphan\nmode. It also supports extra authentication schemes based on\
    \ public-key\ncryptography (RFC 5906). The NTP daemon (<tt>ntpd</tt>) should be\
    \ considered\nfor systems which are normally kept permanently on. Systems which\
    \ are required\nto use broadcast or multicast IP, or to perform authentication\
    \ of packets with\nthe <tt>Autokey</tt> protocol, should consider using <tt>ntpd</tt>.\n\
    <br /><br />\nRefer to\n\n    \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/servers/Configuring_NTP_Using_the_chrony_Suite/'>https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/servers/Configuring_NTP_Using_the_chrony_Suite/</a>\n\
    \nfor more detailed comparison of features of <tt>chronyd</tt>\nand <tt>ntpd</tt>\
    \ daemon features respectively, and for further guidance how to\nchoose between\
    \ the two NTP daemons.\n<br /><br />\nThe upstream manual pages at \n    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'\
    \ href='http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html'>http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html</a>\

    \ of each of the NTP daemons."

description: 'TFTP is a lightweight version of the FTP protocol which has

    traditionally been used to configure networking equipment. However,

    TFTP provides little security, and modern versions of networking

    operating systems frequently support configuration via SSH or other

    more secure protocols. A TFTP server should be run only if no more

    secure method of supporting existing equipment can be

    found.'

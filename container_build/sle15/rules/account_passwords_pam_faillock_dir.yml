description: By setting a `dir` in the faillock configuration account lockouts will
    persist across reboots.
rationale: 'Having lockouts persist across reboots ensures that account is only unlocked
    by an administrator.

    If the lockouts did not persist across reboots an attack could simply reboot the
    system to continue brute force attacks against the accounts on the system.

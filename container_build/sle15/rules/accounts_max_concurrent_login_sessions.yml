description: 'Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit
    risks related to Denial of

    Service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does
    not address

    concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number
    of concurrent

    sessions per user add the following line in <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>
    or

    a file under <tt>/etc/security/limits.d/</tt>:

    <pre>* hard maxlogins <sub idref="var_accounts_max_concurrent_login_sessions"
    /></pre>'
rationale: 'Limiting simultaneous user logins can insulate the system from denial
    of service

    problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes operating improperly
    or

    maliciously may result in an exceptional number of simultaneous login sessions.'

description: 'To configure the system to introduce a delay after failed logon attempts,

    add or correct the <tt>pam_faildelay</tt> settings in

    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> to make sure its <tt>delay</tt> parameter

    is at least <sub idref="var_password_pam_delay" /> or greater. For example:

    <pre>auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=<sub idref="var_password_pam_delay"
    /></pre>'
rationale: 'Limiting the number of logon attempts over a certain time interval reduces

    the chances that an unauthorized user may gain access to an account.'

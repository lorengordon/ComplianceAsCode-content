description: 'The file <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> together with <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>
    provides a

    simple access control mechanism for network services supporting TCP wrappers.

    The following line in the file ensures that access to services supporting this
    mechanism is denied to any clients

    not mentioned in <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>:

    <pre>ALL: ALL</pre>

    It is advised to inspect available network services which might be affected by
    modification of file mentioned above prior to performing the remediation of this
    rule.

    If there exist services which might be affected and access to them should not
    be blocked,

    modify the <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> file appropriately before performing the
    remediation.'
rationale: Correct configuration in <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> ensures that no explicitly
    mentioned clients will be able to connect to services supporting this access control
    mechanism.

        Connections to services originating from hosts not explicitly mentioned in

        To avoid locking down all network access to the system, this rule doesn''t

description: 'The pam_cracklib module''s <tt>lcredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements

    for usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative

    number, any password will be required to contain that many lowercase

    characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1

    additional length credit for each lowercase character.

    Add <tt>lcredit=-1</tt> after pam_cracklib.so to require use of a

    lowercase character in passwords.'
rationale: 'Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing

    attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.'

ocil: 'Check that the operating system enforces password complexity by requiring

    that at least one lower-case character be used by using the following

    command:


    <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password

    password requisite pam_cracklib.so lcredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_lcredit"
    /></pre>


    If the command does not return anything, the returned line is commented

    out, or has a second column value different from "requisite", or does not

    contain <tt>lcredit=<sub idref="var_password_pam_lcredit" /></tt>, this is a finding.


    The DoD and FISMA require at least one lowercase character in a password.

    This would appear as <tt>lcredit=-1</tt>.'

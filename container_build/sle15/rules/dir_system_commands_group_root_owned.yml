description: "System commands are stored in the following directories:\nby default:\n\
    <pre>/bin \n/sbin \n/usr/bin \n/usr/sbin \n/usr/local/bin \n/usr/local/sbin\n\
    </pre>\nAll these directories should have <tt>root</tt> user as a group owner.\
    \ \nIf any system command directory is not group owned by a user other than root\
    \ \ncorrect its ownership with the following command:\n<pre>$ sudo chgrp root\
    \ <i>DIR</i></pre>"
rationale: "If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to \nsoftware\
    \ libraries, then those changes might be implemented without \nundergoing the\
    \ appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a \nrobust change management\
    \ process.\n\nThis requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries\n\
    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.\
    \ \nSoftware libraries also include privileged programs which execute with escalated\
    \ \nprivileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain\
    \ \naccess to information system components for purposes of initiating changes,\
    \ \nincluding upgrades and modifications."

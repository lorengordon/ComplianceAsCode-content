description: Ensure that the system real-time clock (RTC) is set to Coordinated Universal
    Time (UTC).
rationale: 'If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common

    time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.


    Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time.

    Time is commonly expressed in UTC, a modern continuation of GMT, or

    local time with an offset from UTC.'

ocil_clause: the system real-time clock is not configured to use UTC as its time base
ocil: 'To verify that the system real-time clock is set to UTC or GMT, run the following
    command:


    <pre># timedatectl status | grep -i "time zone"</pre>

    <pre># Time zone: UTC (UTC, +0000)</pre>


    If "Timezone" is not set to UTC, this is a finding.

    Fix Text: Configure the SUSE operating system is configured to use UTC.

    To configure the system time zone to use UTC or GMT, run the following command,
    replacing [ZONE] with "UTC" or "GMT".

    <pre># sudo timedatectl set-timezone [ZONE]</pre>'

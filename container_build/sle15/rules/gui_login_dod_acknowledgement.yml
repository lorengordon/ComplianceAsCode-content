description: 'Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting
    access to the SUSE operating system ensures privacy and security notification
    verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
    policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.<br/><br/>


    The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user access
    to the SUSE operating system. This provides assurance that the user has seen the
    message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is not acknowledged
    by the user, DoD will not be in compliance with system use notifications required
    by law.<br/><br/>


    System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with
    human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.<br/><br/>


    The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the
    following verbiage for the SUSE operating system:


    <pre>You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
    provided for USG-authorized use only.


    By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent
    to the following conditions:


    -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes
    including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network
    operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence
    (CI) investigations.


    -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.


    -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject
    to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used
    for any USG-authorized purpose.


    -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls)
    to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.


    -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE
    or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications,
    or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys,
    psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work
    product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.</pre>


    Check the configuration by running the following command:


    <pre># more /etc/gdm/Xsession</pre>


    The beginning of the file must contain the following text immediately after <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt>:


    <pre>if ! zenity --text-info \

    --title "Consent" \

    --filename=/etc/gdm/banner \

    --no-markup \

    --checkbox="Accept." 10 10; then

    sleep 1;

    exit 1;

    fi</pre>'

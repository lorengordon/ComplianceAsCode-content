description: "Disables support for legacy 32-bit programs under a 64-bit kernel.\n\
    \nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n\
    \    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION</tt>, run\
    \ the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION /boot/config-*</tt>\n\
    \    \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either\
    \ commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: Disabling 32-bit backwards compatibility helps reduce the attack surface.

warnings:
-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
        the appropriate value for the config.
-   general: Only disable support for 32-bit programs if you are sure you don't need
        any 32-bit program.

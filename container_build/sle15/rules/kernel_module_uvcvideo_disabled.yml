description: If the device contains a camera it should be covered or disabled when
    not in use.
rationale: 'Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e., cameras)
    can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information.

    Providing easy methods to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative
    computing session helps to ensure participants actually carry out the disconnect
    activity without having to go through complex and tedious procedures.'

ocil_clause: the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out,
    and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use
ocil: 'If the device or SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 does not have a camera installed,
    this requirement is not applicable.


    This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets),
    where the use of the camera is a local AO decision.


    This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved
    VTC locations that are centrally managed.


    For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually
    disconnect the camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is
    a finding.


    For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g., laptop
    camera cover slide) when not in use. If the built-in camera is not protected with
    a camera cover, or is not physically disabled, this is a finding.


    If the camera is not disconnected, covered, or physically disabled, determine
    if it is being disabled via software with the following commands:


    Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the uvcvideo kernel module.


    $ sudo grep -r uvcvideo /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "/bin/true"


    install uvcvideo /bin/true'

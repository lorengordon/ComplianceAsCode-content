<td>Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system.
Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers who may have compromised their credentials.
Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.</td>
<td>To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
the following line in <code>/etc/default/useradd</code>:

disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 60

elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<code>useradd</code> man page for more information.</td>

<td>Configure AIDE to Verify Extended Attributes</td>
<td>Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata
with security implications.</td>
<td>By default, the <code>xattrs</code> option is added to the <code>FIPSR</code> ruleset in AIDE.
If using a custom ruleset or the <code>xattrs</code> option is missing, add <code>xattrs</code>
to the appropriate ruleset.
For example, add <code>xattrs</code> to the following line in <code>/etc/aide.conf</code>:
<pre>FIPSR = p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+acl+selinux+xattrs+sha256</pre>
AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that is already
configured by default.

The remediation provided with this rule adds <code>xattrs</code> to all rule sets available in
<code>/etc/aide.conf</code>
</td>
<td><pre>To determine that AIDE is verifying extended file attributes, run the following command:
$ grep xattrs /etc/aide.conf
Verify that the xattrs option is added to the correct ruleset.
      Is it the case that the xattrs option is missing or not added to the correct ruleset?

This measure protects against or limits effects of DoS attacks against the system.
Set the system to implement rate-limiting measures by adding the following line to
<code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or a configuration file in the <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> directory
(or modify the line to have the required value):
<pre>net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = <xccdf-1.2:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.2="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.2" idref="xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_value_sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_invalid_ratelimit_value" use="legacy"></xccdf-1.2:sub></pre>
Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:
<pre># sysctl --system</pre>
</td>
<td><pre>To verify that the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS
attacks by ensuring implementation of rate-limiting measures
on impacted network interfaces, run the following command:
# grep 'net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
The command should output the following line:
/etc/sysctl.conf:net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = 
The file where the line has been found can differ, but it must be either /etc/sysctl.conf
or a file located under the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory.
      Is it the case that rate limiting of duplicate TCP acknowledgments is not configured?

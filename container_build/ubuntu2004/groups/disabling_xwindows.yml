description: 'Unless there is a mission-critical reason for the

    system to run a graphical user interface, ensure X is not set to start

    automatically at boot and remove the X Windows software packages.

    There is usually no reason to run X Windows

    on a dedicated server system, as it increases the system''s attack surface and
    consumes

    system resources. Administrators of server systems should instead login via

    SSH or on the text console.'

description: 'The Linux kernel in Ubuntu provides a packet filtering system called

    netfilter, and the traditional interface for manipulating netfilter are

    the iptables suite of commands. iptables provide a complete firewall

    solution that is both highly configurable and highly flexible.


    Becoming proficient in iptables takes time, and getting started with

    netfilter firewalling using only iptables can be a daunting task. As a

    result, many frontends for iptables have been created over the years,

    each trying to achieve a different result and targeting a different

    audience.


    The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is

    particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a

    framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface

    for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use

    interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the

    same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an

    administrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream

    for other distributions and graphical frontends.'

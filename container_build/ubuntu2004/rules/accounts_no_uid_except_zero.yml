description: 'If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration
    should

    be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have

    their UID changed.

    <br />

    If the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID

    should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000."

    Otherwise assign a UID greater than "1000" that has not already been

    assigned.'
rationale: 'An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts

    with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to

    guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of

    sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators

    access to root privileges in an accountable manner.'

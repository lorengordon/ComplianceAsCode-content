description: 'Verify that the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the

    password complexity rules.


    Verify the pwquality module is being enforced by operating system by

    running the following command:

    <pre>

    $ grep -i enforcing /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    enforcing = 1

    </pre>


    If the value of "enforcing" is not "1" or the line is commented out,

    this is a finding.'
rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources

    required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,

    is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at

    guessing and brute-force attacks. Using enforcing=1 ensures "pwquality"

    enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability

    to limit brute-force attacks on the system.'

description: Remove the <tt>UMASK</tt> environment variable from all interactive users
    initialization files.
rationale: 'The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files.
    A

    umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive. Although umask can

    be represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special

    access modes is typically ignored or required to be 0. This requirement

    applies to the globally configured system defaults and the local interactive

    user defaults for each account on the system.'

description: 'Configure the operating system to audit the execution of the partition

    management program "fdisk".'
rationale: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security

    and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to

    establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an

    incident or identify those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the

    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).'

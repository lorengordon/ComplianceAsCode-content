description: 'The Ubuntu 20.04 operating system must allocate audit record storage

    capacity to store at least one weeks worth of audit records when audit

    records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage

    facility.


    The partition size needed to capture a week''s worth of audit records is

    based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity

    available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit

    records will be sufficient.


    Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the

    following command:


    <pre>$ sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</pre>


    Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to with the

    following command:


    <pre>$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/

    /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit</pre>'
rationale: 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental

    deletion or alteration. Off-loading is a common process in information

    systems with limited audit storage capacity.'

    system or media from the system being audited, run the following command:

    The output should return something similar to where <i>REMOTE_SYSTEM</i>

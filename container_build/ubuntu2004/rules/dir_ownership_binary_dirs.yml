    All these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> user.

    If any directory <i>DIR</i> in these directories is found

    to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the

    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>DIR</i></pre>'
rationale: 'System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services,

    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their

    execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.'

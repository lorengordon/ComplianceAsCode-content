description: 'If there is a mission-critical reason for users to access their accounts
    via the insecure FTP protocol, limit the set of users who are allowed this access.
    Edit the vsftpd configuration file. Add or correct the following configuration
    options:

    <pre>userlist_enable=YES

    userlist_file=/etc/vsftp.ftpusers

    userlist_deny=NO</pre>

    Edit the file <tt>/etc/vsftp.ftpusers</tt>. For each user USERNAME who should
    be allowed to access the system via FTP, add a line containing that user''s name:

    <pre>USERNAME</pre>

    If anonymous access is also required, add the anonymous usernames to <tt>/etc/vsftp.ftpusers</tt>
    as well.

    <pre>anonymous

    ftp</pre>'
rationale: Historically, the file <tt>/etc/ftpusers</tt> contained a list of users
    who were not allowed to access the system via FTP. It was used to prevent system
    users such as the root user from logging in via the insecure FTP protocol. However,
    when the configuration option <tt>userlist deny=NO</tt> is set, vsftpd interprets
    ftpusers as the set of users who are allowed to login via FTP. Since it should
    be possible for most users to access their accounts via secure protocols, it is
    recommended that this setting be used, so that non-anonymous FTP access can be
    limited to legacy users who have been explicitly identified.

description: 'Spectre V2 is an indirect branch poisoning attack that can lead to data
    leakage.

    An exploit for Spectre V2 tricks the indirect branch predictor into executing

    code from a future indirect branch chosen by the attacker, even if the privilege

    level is different.


    Since Linux Kernel 4.15 you can check the Spectre V2 mitigation state with the
    following command:

    <tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2</tt>


    Enforce the Spectre V2 mitigation by adding the argument

    <tt>spectre_v2=on</tt> to the default

    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.

    To ensure that <tt>spectre_v2=on)</tt> is added as a kernel command line

    argument to newly installed kernels, add <tt>spectre_v2=on)</tt> to the

    default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems. Modify the line within

    <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:

    <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... spectre_v2=on) ..."</pre>

    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre>#
    update-grub</pre>'
rationale: 'The Spectre V2 vulnerability allows an attacker to read memory that he
    should not have

    access to.'

ocil: 'Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system

    in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. If it includes <tt>spectre_v2=on</tt>,

    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.

    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following
    command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*spectre_v2=on.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>

    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with

    <pre>$ sudo grep ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*spectre_v2=on.*'' /etc/default/grub</pre>.Moreover,
    current Grub config file <tt>grub.cfg</tt> must be checked. The file can be found

    either in <tt>/boot/grub</tt> in case of legacy BIOS systems, or in <tt>/boot/grub</tt>
    in case of UEFI systems.

    If they include <tt>spectre_v2=on</tt>, then the parameter

    is configured at boot time.

    <pre>$ sudo grep vmlinuz GRUB_CFG_FILE_PATH | grep -v ''spectre_v2=on''</pre>

    Fill in <tt>GRUB_CFG_FILE_PATH</tt> based on information above.

    This command should not return any output.'

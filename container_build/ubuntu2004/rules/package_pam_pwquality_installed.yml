    The <code>libpam-pwquality</code> package can be installed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

    $ apt-get install libpam-pwquality</pre>'
rationale: 'Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required

    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure

    of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and

    brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction

    configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.'

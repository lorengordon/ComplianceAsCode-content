description: 'The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used

    for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or

    logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.

    Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in its own partition enables the setting of more

    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.'

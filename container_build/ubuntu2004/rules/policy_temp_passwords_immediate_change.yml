description: 'Temporary passwords for Ubuntu 20.04 operating system logons must

    require an immediate change to a permanent password.


    Verify that a policy exists that ensures when a user is created, it is

    creating using a method that forces a user to change their password upon

    their next login.'
rationale: 'Without providing this capability, an account may be created without a

    password. Nonrepudiation cannot be guaranteed once an account is created if

    a user is not forced to change the temporary password upon initial logon.


    Temporary passwords are typically used to allow access when new accounts

    are created or passwords are changed. It is common practice for

    administrators to create temporary passwords for user accounts that allow

    the users to log on, yet force them to change the password once they have

    successfully authenticated.'

    Configure the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system to allow the use of a

    temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a

    permanent password.


    Using one of the acceptable methods listed below, force a user to change

    their password on their next logon by replacing "[UserName]" in the one of the

    following commands:


    <pre># chage -d 0 [UserName]

    # passwd -e [UserName]</pre>'

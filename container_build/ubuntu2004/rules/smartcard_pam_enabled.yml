rationale: 'Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than

    that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI

    (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.


    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate

    from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is

    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the

    authentication device.


    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information

    systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing

    time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the

    U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common

    Access Card.'

ocil: 'Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an

    authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an

    external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods

    include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.


    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the

    function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g.,

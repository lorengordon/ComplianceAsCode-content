description: 'The Ubuntu 20.04 operating system must have vlock installed to allow
    for session locking.



    The <code>vlock</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ apt-get install vlock</pre>'
rationale: 'A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and

    moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information

    system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of

    the absence.


    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can

    be determined.


    Regardless of where the session lock is determined and implemented,

    once invoked, the session lock must remain in place until the user

    reauthenticates. No other activity aside from reauthentication must

    unlock the system.'

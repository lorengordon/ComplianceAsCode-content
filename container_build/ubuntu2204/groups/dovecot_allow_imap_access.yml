    The default iptables configuration does not allow inbound access to any services.

    This modification will allow remote hosts to initiate connections to the IMAP
    daemon,

    while keeping all other ports on the server in their default protected state.

    To configure <tt>iptables</tt> to allow port 143 traffic, one must edit

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and

    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use).

    Add the following line, ensuring that it appears before the final LOG and DROP
    lines for the INPUT chain:

    <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 143 -j ACCEPT</pre>'

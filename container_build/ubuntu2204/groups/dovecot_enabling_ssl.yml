description: "SSL should be used to encrypt network traffic between the \nDovecot\
    \ server and its clients. Users must authenticate to the Dovecot \nserver in order\
    \ to read their mail, and passwords should never be \ntransmitted in clear text.\
    \ In addition, protecting mail as it is \ndownloaded is a privacy measure, and\
    \ clients may use SSL certificates \nto authenticate the server, preventing another\
    \ system from impersonating \nthe server."

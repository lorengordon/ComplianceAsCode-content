description: 'The umask setting controls the default permissions

    for the creation of new files.

    With a default <tt>umask</tt> setting of 077, files and directories

    created by users will not be readable by any other user on the

    system. Users who wish to make specific files group- or

    world-readable can accomplish this by using the chmod command.

    Additionally, users can make all their files readable to their

    group by default by setting a <tt>umask</tt> of 027 in their shell

    configuration files. If default per-user groups exist (that is, if

    every user has a default group whose name is the same as that

    user''s username and whose only member is the user), then it may

    even be safe for users to select a <tt>umask</tt> of 007, making it very

    easy to intentionally share files with groups of which the user is

    a member.

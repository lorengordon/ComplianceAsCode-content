description: 'Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes
    the

    risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate. This system

    should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as

    one based on Identity Management tools such as Active Directory, Kerberos,

    Directory Server, etc.'
rationale: 'A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps
    to

    ensure the accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and

    promptly addressed. Enterprise environments make user account management

    challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to

    manually address account management functions adds risk of potential

    oversight.'
severity: medium

ocil_clause: the system is not using a centralized authentication mechanism, or it
    is not automated
ocil: 'Verify that the system is integrated with a centralized authentication mechanism

    such as as Active Directory, Kerberos, Directory Server, etc. that has

    automated account mechanisms in place.'

description: 'Verify that the Apparmor tool is configured to

    control whitelisted applications and user home directory access

    control.<br/><br/>


    The <code>apparmor</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable apparmor.service</pre>'
rationale: 'Using a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing

    the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software

    decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>


    The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit

    execution of authorized software by adding each authorized program to the

    "pam_apparmor" exception policy. The process used to identify software

    programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information

    systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.<br/><br/>


    Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system

    startup.<br/><br/>


    Users'' home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive

    nature. Nonprivileged users should coordinate any sharing of information

    with a System Administrator (SA) through shared resources.<br/><br/>


    Apparmor can confine users to their home directory, not allowing them to

    make any changes outside of their own home directories. Confining users to

    their home directory will minimize the risk of sharing information.'

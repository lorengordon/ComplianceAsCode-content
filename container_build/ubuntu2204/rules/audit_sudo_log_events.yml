description: 'The Ubuntu 22.04 operating system must generate audit records for

    privileged activities, nonlocal maintenance, diagnostic sessions and

    other system-level access.


    Verify the operating system audits activities performed during nonlocal

    maintenance and diagnostic sessions. Run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo auditctl -l | grep sudo.log

    -w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k maintenance</pre>'
rationale: 'If events associated with nonlocal administrative access or diagnostic

    sessions are not logged, a major tool for assessing and investigating

    attacks would not be available.

    This requirement addresses auditing-related issues associated with

    maintenance tools used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions

    on organizational information systems.

    Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities

    conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an

    external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network. Local

    maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried

    out by individuals physically present at the information system or

    information system component and not communicating across a network

    connection.

    This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test

    equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software

    components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a

    part of the system, for example, the software implementing "ping,"

    "ls," "ipconfig," or the hardware and software implementing the

    monitoring port of an Ethernet switch.'

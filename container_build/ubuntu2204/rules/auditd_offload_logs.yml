    offload audit events of standalone systems.'
rationale: 'Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or

    incidental deletion or alteration.

    Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited

    weekly.

    Check if there is a script in the "/etc/cron.weekly" directory that

    offloads audit data:

    <pre># sudo ls /etc/cron.weekly

    audit-offload</pre>

    Check if the script inside the file does offloading of audit logs to

    external media.

    If the script file does not exist or does not offload audit logs, this

    is a finding.'

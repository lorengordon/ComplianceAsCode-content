description: 'Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity

    of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and

    systems connected over a network.'
rationale: 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and

    can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a

    particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting

    forensic analysis and investigating system events.'

rationale: 'Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can
    select which events

    are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical

    events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system''s performance by overwhelming

    the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish,

    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify

    those responsible for one.'

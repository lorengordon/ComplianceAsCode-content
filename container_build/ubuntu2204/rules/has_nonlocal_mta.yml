description: 'Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to

    listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate

    user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server,

    it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.'
rationale: 'The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a

    long history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that

    the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have

    the MTA''s daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to

    be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.'

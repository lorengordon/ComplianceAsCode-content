description: 'The <tt>talk</tt> package contains the client program for the

    Internet talk protocol, which allows the user to chat with other users on

    different systems. Talk is a communication program which copies lines from one

    terminal to the terminal of another user.

    The <code>talk</code> package can be removed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ apt-get remove talk</pre>'
rationale: 'The talk software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols

    for communications. Removing the <tt>talk</tt> package decreases the

    risk of the accidental (or intentional) activation of talk client program.'

description: 'In <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>, add or correct the following line to ensure

    the system will use <sub idref="var_password_hashing_algorithm" /> as the hashing
    algorithm:

    <pre>ENCRYPT_METHOD <sub idref="var_password_hashing_algorithm" /></pre>'
rationale: 'Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords.

    If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and
    easily compromised. Passwords

    that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
    kept in plain text.

    <br /><br />

    Using a stronger hashing algorithm makes password cracking attacks more difficult.'

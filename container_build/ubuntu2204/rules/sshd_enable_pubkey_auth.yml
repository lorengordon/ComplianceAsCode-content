description: 'Enable SSH login with public keys.

    <br/>

    The default SSH configuration enables authentication based on public keys. The
    appropriate

    configuration is used if no value is set for <tt>PubkeyAuthentication</tt>.

    <br/>

    To explicitly enable Public Key Authentication, add or correct the following



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>PubkeyAuthentication yes</pre>'
rationale: "Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to\n\
    privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication\nrequires\
    \ using two or more factors to achieve authentication.\nA privileged account is\
    \ defined as an information system account with\nauthorizations of a privileged\
    \ user. \nThe DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor\nauthentication."

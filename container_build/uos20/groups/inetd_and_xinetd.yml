description: 'The <tt>xinetd</tt> service acts as a dedicated listener for some

    network services (mostly, obsolete ones) and can be used to provide access

    controls and perform some logging. It has been largely obsoleted by other

    features, and it is not installed by default. The older Inetd service

    is not even available as part of UnionTech OS Server 20.'

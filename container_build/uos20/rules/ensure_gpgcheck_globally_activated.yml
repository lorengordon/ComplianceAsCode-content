description: 'The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether

    RPM packages'' signatures are always checked prior to installation.

    To configure yum to check package signatures before installing

    them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> in

    the <tt>[main]</tt> section:

    <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>'
rationale: 'Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the

    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the

    software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a

    trusted vendor.

    <br />

    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system

    components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the

    organization.

    <br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation

    validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.

    This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been

    provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by

    this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an

    approved Certificate Authority (CA).'

description: 'Rsyslogd is a system utility providing support for message logging.
    Support

    for both internet and UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both
    local

    and remote logging.  Couple this utility with <tt>gnutls</tt> (which is a secure
    communications

    library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to
    securely

    encrypt and off-load auditing.


    When using <tt>rsyslogd</tt> to off-load logs the remote system must be authenticated.'
rationale: 'The audit records generated by Rsyslog contain valuable information regarding
    system

    configuration, user authentication, and other such information. Audit records
    should be

    protected from unauthorized access.'

            Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit

            UnionTech OS Server 20 installation media provides "rsyslogd".  "rsyslogd"

            "Rsyslog" supported authentication modes include:

            anon - anonymous authentication

            x509/fingerprint - certificate fingerprint authentication

            x509/certvalid - certificate validation only

            x509/name - certificate validation and subject name authentication'
